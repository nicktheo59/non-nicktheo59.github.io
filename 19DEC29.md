Why not me?
I'm beginning to believe that because I find myself developed to the degree that I could be capable of formulating these questions--that I,  within my lifetime, should be very capabile of answering them^ with enough timely dedication spent towards to solving it satisfactorily /  answering it (^or at least having deep fun of exploration along the way).

I've said many times that adaptive/transisent punctuation 'rules', a more impressionist writing style, and covert sentence structure linking are all tools in my armoury to achieve my [competing] writing objectives:
- Achieve concrete communication and connection with the reader WHEN what I am communicating in that very sentence is a more concrete idea. -> For that I employ the writing heuristic of George Orwell; to write as simply as possible without tarnishing the depth of what you are saying.
- Punctuation is to help ME express/trasmit what I was conceptualising into english language whilst writing it--without dewelling on 'correct' usage for too long in the moment which would otherwise slow me down and derail the flow of what I was saying.
- There will be occasion sporadic jumps, backtracks, and temporary explorations--for my own [more satisfactory] form of expression.
- Using a more diverse vocabuary, with occasional flourishes; witl ame it smore enjoyable to write as well as read (hopefully) and will also exercise my dying/diminishing 'vocab neurons' to suspend advancement of early-onset Alzheimer's.
- Attempt to be minimalist - create useful passages of text (that are compact but digestible).

It is 4:45pm, 
I am yet to Eat a Frog.
I spent 2 or so hours earlier writing the introduction to (15 Minute Fulfilment) -- all because I heard that spending 15minutes outside in the sun is necessary to get your daily dose of Vitmin D. All because I googled the name of a 'Wodstar' athlete mentioned in a Youtube comment which led me to an Instagram clip (if you want to go that far). And even further - the video of was how to do a [russian] kettle bell swing correctly because I had listened to Joe Rogan interview Pavel ... which re-ignited my desire to get stronger from reading 4 Hour Body Years ago.

Now to collect YAYA.. then Frog.

It's now midnight LOL.

Certainly did not waste the day however.

I dissapeared just now for a bit into a 'global heuristic' idea that i posted on Twitter. Did a bit of garage rumaging that led me to a book on The Biology of Cancer - remember that innnovate UK competition, is it still active?

But now I have relaxed enough - both with family and independently.

And I am increasing my informational bandwidth mode at this heitened level of consciousness that I discovered. I'm at my current peak in that regard.

Gave mum a book on kindle - i'm sure I bought the same one in paper back.

Right now I was planning my next move- 'Second sunday' fortnightly update snapshots? Annual review of my 2019? 
Would be cool to go to quiz with someone from Bham that I'm overdue a catch up with.

Also need to reduce down weight-wise even if I'm not 'fat' per se. 
A muscle gain / weight loss programme starts today -- remember when you used to geniunely enjoy the feeling of being hungry in India-- You can recover that habit for more momentum.
My kidneys actually hurt if I slouch, I need to move around much much more - remember that withings watch stepcounter-- where did it go?
I cheap comfortable 

Call Callan about the Citizen watch he left in Belguim.


Continue to collect 15 Minute Fulfilment rituals -- start a MENU of rituals as a WIKI and allow others to contribute to it within this NIKIPEDIA-type github pages structure.

If I do do that - perhaps change the Hacker theme to make it more readable - maybe figure out how to edit the CSS for this template-- I would still like it to have a DARK mode for my own preference however --- just use a chrome extension fo that obvi - abstract as much of that unecessary work away. Self-reliance is important for the core things that matter but time is also very limited and scarce. At least for me and my situation.


EPSOM

I decided that I want a job in AR/VR corporate-industrial-enterprise training, preferably as a product owner / a both client and developer facing role. 

To do that:
1. Interview prep - it is on my desk in the form of an IOP booklet and OBS recording setup. Cut your hair.
2. Have a vision for yourself
3. Understand the role and responsibilities - learn how to get on well with Japanese by familiarising yourself with their traditions and customs.


Today I learnt how to cook CARPAMA - gollogasi... and how to analyse the food with hyper-spectral ... it's is in MIT tech review somewhere. 
I could read the emerging trends for 2020 from this year's Scientific American. 

Put the CARPAMA to practise soon or write down the recipe... Peel, chop, glaze in Oil. Oven Tray first by itself then with Celery Corriander Onion Garlic(?) PORK Potatoes anything else(?), at some point wine is added. Towards the last 20 minutes of oven (what temp?) add Tomatoe Puree (and the wine).

What biases are there that explain investing more time into a banal/irrelevant sink that has occasionally been a source of great advice and knowledge/wisdom/information - but this time it is seemingly / objectively banal, yet we feel still compelling to invest more time into the endeavour 'just in case'. Kind of like what I am doing now by writing down this very plan to find the bias for continuing to do what you do when there is seemingly no reason. (My originally thinking was more to do with YouTubers and how people often recommendations-binge, but just I am Sanguine or one of the 3 other red blue green yellow traits that Hippocratus mentioned - I automatically take that extra step to extrapolate and generalise.) 

I think the Siver's Book How to Live will be very good.

Holy fuck it is 12:42am
Now you really know where the time goes.

Now it is 1:31am but I came up with a very good obsessive thought to hold (and swap in)

Am I daydreaming?
