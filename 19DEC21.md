I used nt+2 and Paperspace to rent a GPU machine at $5 + $0.57 per hour

Plan is to update / sideload virtual desktop 1.6+
Install Sidequest, read about Oculus Link, 
Download African Quill 

Login to Paperspace on Windows 7 Toshiba, plug in the OculusQuest usb Cable
Run whatever software is needed for Quill, (also Tvori, AnimVR, and a potentially also create a Unity / Blender Development workflow)
Download Jared's GaussLab software from Dropbox

1. DBX & GDrive downloads

184.105.181.193  = public IP for my shadow box
Could install Apache PHP and put files in the http folder

##Update

Only thing left is to install the sideloaded apk version of Virtual Desktop on the quest over usb using SideQuest
I would also install Jared's .apk file via the same method so that it appears in 'Unknown Devices' -> as would sideloaded VD.

For African Quill, as with GaussLab, the extracted zips are on the Desktop. To run it I would load up the Quill app via Oculus Desktop -> Library 
(or alternatively I could load up a Steam VR game), then I would run REVIVE to then 'trick' Oculus Desktop that my device is an Oculus Rift.
Oculus Link apparently makes this REVIVE step redundant but instead there would need to be a usb cable connected from the PC to the Quest.

Finally the running of the Virtual Desktop streamer on this cloud gaming pc (windows server in desktop mode with GPU) 
means that when the sideloaded VD is accessed from the Quest it is accessing this cloud pc (a purchase of VD via the official store links your username, entering this username in the streamer then authenticates/whitelists your connection).

1. Get a usb connection going with SideQuest 
2. Drop x2 .apk files onto the headset
3. Load them both up from Oculus Home to confirm / play
4. Open VD again and Open Quill and Revive using the PC mode 
5. Open the Roomscale African movie from within Quill (?)
6. Marvel
