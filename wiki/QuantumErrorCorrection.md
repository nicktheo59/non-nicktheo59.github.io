Quantum Error Correction

***

## Why is it important?

One of my 'talents' is to hone in on an alien topic like Quantum Computing to quickly pick out or summarise the seemingly most important elements. The reason for the 'quotes' is because it has it's roots in a story much akin to that story of Richard Feynmann just trying to understand the guys explaining nuclear reactor blueprints to him [+[the story] to your Personal Knowledge Cloud].

QEC, as well as to-be-discovered methods for pulling it off, was something that I identified to be the critical piece. 

The field of Quantum Computing is something of an arms race purely for the fact that the first team to achieve it could (in secret) use it to break encryption standards like TLS very efficiently (?). 

There is something called the Open Quantum Safe project that has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography but as of now I couldn't say whether it would be resistant to

This capabililty however is double-edged sword more broadly, because in the closely related field of Quantum Communications there is an algorithm called [X] which I personally christened "Eve's Algorithm" because it enables you to know _for sure_ whether or not you have an Eavesdropper on communications line.

My hunch is we will go through some 'wild west' phase where a motivated individual could quantumly decrypt stuff like internet banking transactions -- but then again probably not because if a responsible quantum computing service provider would ask for ID credentials etc. (I'm assuming they didn't build their own one). 

Anyway it would all be for the better if have the capability to know about potential Eavesdroppers to the line to wait and try again later -- but yet again maybe not because the US would not have reliable oversight to enforce sanctions on rogue states or participate in 'other' intelligence gathering activities that help bring peace and stability in the world -- unless they just continue doing what they do and simply don't care -- then both Quantum Communications and Edward Snowden become moot(!)
