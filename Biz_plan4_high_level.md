Auto-Shares is ultimately a highly disruptive pensions product. We make it easy for car owners to sell fractional ownership of their vehicles [to pensioners] then automatically and securely collect usage payments from car riders/drivers, these "per ride" payments are then distributed to the now _multiple_ car equity holders. Our solar-powered, retrofit, cloud-connected smart system (called TUTU) will ship out of the box with Open Pilot v1.0 - the 'Android' alternative to Tesla's Open pilot. Initially we are focused on highly ultilised commercial vehicles driving a fairly predictable number of business miles per year (leaning towards the financing of prospective EV owners). Compared to the typical life-time annuity product, our *3-year-at-a-time* product represents x2.5 times better value -- all the while providing a compelling business case for companies (and eventually individuals) to transistion to "Pay as you go" electric vehicles or simply help finance their fleets in the most flexible way possible, in a way that makes sense for them. 




Tinkerbricks is a Virtual World where science students can come together and encounter the intricacies of human ingenuity at unprecedented levels of fidelity ("Immersive learning"). 
The business model is to re-create scientific objects as "branded" digital assets. Distinct from mainstream advertising channels, Tinkerbricks is where the world's greatest companies can attract the mindshare of tomorrow's engineers. Allocating the "brandable" digital assets and experiences will decided by regularly holding a competitive auction between relevant corporate sponsors. 
These learning experiences are simply not reprodicible on a classroom white board, and although Tbricks may supplement a teacher-led course of study (or even be introduced by teachers in the classroom) there are clear advantages to this new paradigm / learning environment - with deep implications for teaching & learning:
Visual & Immersive Learning - overlay extra-sensory information (such as Magnetic Force lines); 
Self-Paced & Adaptive learning - replayable explanations (or turn 'hints mode' on or off);
Niche & Cost-effective Teaching (with Software-like margins);
Safe Learning - emulate a hazardous enviroments.
The other major opportunity here is that recorded user inputs can be used to demonstrate and validate skills or knowledge possessed by final year students soon seeking to gain employment - data of successful students would be optionally shared with sponsoring employers to dramatically improve their recruitment cost-effectiveness.
