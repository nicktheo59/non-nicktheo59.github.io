Imagine you are going on a secret / last-minute trip and immediately take care of the tasks you have to get done before you leave.
Do this consistently.
If you can work unsupervised  == and can develop a sense of urgency == you can become a leader.

To take caffeine at night would be a mistake - I am sensitive to stimulants
I got on here to calculate my networth - I forgetfully left it mid-task last time
My goal is to be worth £20m+ but it isn't a dream. I geniunely am optimising every micro-decision that I make to walk towards this outcome.
A regular routine for my productivity and body would be wise.
I will treat myself to a hot chocolate when I complete my frog tasks.

My answer is -4400. Is it time to liquidate Binance holdings? 
Would love to complain to the authorities about the exchange cex (not the comp store) and also Hashflare..but I really do have better things to do right now. Same with the HSBC £20 reclaim. Though I should do it.

Closing down ii would be another line of action.

Checking slc finally
