Day before my 29th birthday I really enjoyed the home visit from YAYA yesterday = it was a well needed break.
Tomorrow I will finally pick up my lenses and then get lunch / dinner at her house in Mesogi. I will organise an Android Tablet or iOS with Wireless charging locked on Skype with Guided Access Mode.
All her friends and family will be a button press away - both traditional telephone audio for non-internet recipients and traditional skype video call sessions. I cam find a way to easily top-up the any needed Skype credit.

I just installed Git Bash (though lots of configuration options I was not fully knowledgable about).
I just signed up for a DatoCMS account so that I can create a Gatsby website using their template portfolio theme that seemed good. There are advantages to learning this 'JAM' Stacks as it is called - not least the fact that this is all written in React which is a popular framework to learn. 

Also I signed up for a Descript account to test my bedtime story podcast/youtube channel idea.

Just realised that I need to change my business address listed on Barclays so that I can apply for a new card..hope that they don't query companies house in order to get this info. I could simply list Kemp House as usual then pick it up in person.

As usual getting stuck - - for some reason i'm installing yarn to be able to run my gatsby portfolio repo locally,
and I maybe need to add the .msi file to my PATH ?

Right now I'm attempting to figure out how DESCRIPT works.
I'm considering to build Neighbourhood Watch app tonight.
I would like to finish my GATSBY DatoCRM setup

Just an update - The Overdub feature in Descript is apparently still in private beta. Also i'm not sure it will be suitable for my purposes of entire transcripts. Another sucky company by Andrew Mason.

I will bathe to get warm, check-in with proximity seats on Jet2. Worth the extra Â£40?
I will tick off my list.
