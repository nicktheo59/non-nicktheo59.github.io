What is a Credit Card Suitable For?

- You can use your Vanquis Visa credit card to buy goods and services at over 24 million Visa merchants around the world, online, by mail order or over the phone.

- You can also use your Vanquis Visa credit card to withdraw cash from cash machines.

- A fee may be charged for certain services, such as cash withdrawals. Please refer to the Pre-Contract Credit Information and Terms and Conditions for more information.

- Your Vanquis Visa credit card gives you the financial freedom to make your life a little easier. Just use your Vanquis Visa credit card and as long as you meet your minimum payments you can repay over a period that suits you and your budget.

- Always think about whether you can afford at least the minimum payment before making a purchase on your credit card.

- Credit cards are not suitable for long-term borrowing or financing existing debt.

Managing Your Account

- Unless there is no money owing on your account, we'll send you a monthly statement, but should you need to know your balance or how much you could spend, then just call our 24 hour telephone information service. Or go to https://www.vanquis.co.uk/ and register for eVanquis, our 24/7 online and SMS account service.

How Your Account Works

- There is no annual fee on your Vanquis Visa credit card account.

- You will need to repay a percentage of the balance outstanding on your account every month. For more information on this see ‘Your Monthly Payments’ below.

- If you make a payment late, miss a payment, don’t pay at least your minimum payment or go over your credit limit, you will be charged a £12 fee.

- Any fees will be clearly shown on your monthly statement.

- Different interest rates may apply to different types of transactions, so some transactions may incur more interest than others. Your interest rates may be increased in the future, for example where the risk of you breaking your agreement with us changes due to changes in your credit status, the cost of providing your account and services on it changes beyond our reasonable control, or to reflect changes in regulatory requirements or in any code of practice affecting our business and our costs in complying with them. We will tell you at least 30 days before any such increases take effect.

- If you use your Vanquis Visa credit card only for purchases and pay your account balance in full every month, you will not pay a penny in interest.

- We may increase the fees and charges on your Vanquis Visa credit card account, for example we may change default fees to reflect a change in the average costs or losses we reasonably expect to incur as a result of the breach which causes the default fee to be payable, we may change money transfer fees to respond proportionately to a change in the risk of you breaking your agreement with us and generally to respond proportionately to a change in the value of money or a change in the law or any code of practice affecting our business. We will tell you at least 30 days before any such increases take effect.

- For more details of interest rates and fees and charges and when we may change them, please see your Pre-Contract Credit Information or your Terms and Conditions below.

What’s My Credit Limit?

- You’ll start with a manageable credit limit from £250 to £1,000.

- It is important that you don’t go over the credit limit on your credit card account as this could have consequences, such as fees being charged and your credit rating being affected adversely.

Your Monthly Payments

- Unless there is no money owing on your account, every month, you will need to pay a percentage of the balance outstanding on your account. We will tell you what your monthly minimum payment percentage is when we open your account.

- Your monthly statement will clearly show the minimum payment you need to pay and by when you need to pay it (the 'payment due date'). Your minimum payment may vary from month to month depending on how you’ve used your account. For more information about how we calculate your minimum payment, please refer to the Summary Box.

- It is important that you make your monthly payments on time. Missing payments or not making the minimum payment in full could have severe consequences, such as incurring additional interest making the total cost of your debt grow, fees being charged and your credit rating being affected adversely, making it harder to get credit or increasing the cost of credit in the future. We may increase the interest rates we charge you on your account. In the worst case you may be involved in legal proceedings which may cause you additional cost and expense to recover what you owe.

- You must pay us even if you do not receive a monthly statement showing the amount due. If this happens, you can find out how much you need to pay either by contacting our customer service department or by checking your account online or using the Vanquis mobile app.

- You can repay at a level that suits you as long as the amount you repay is at least the minimum payment. If you choose to only make the minimum payment every month, it would take longer and cost you more to pay off the balance.

- Please refer to the Summary Box for an example.

Continuous Payment Authority

- As part of the application process for the Vanquis Visa credit card, we may ask you to set up a continuous payment authority, a ‘CPA’, on a payment account of yours (such as your current account). Should your application be successful, we will use the CPA to request payments from that account in respect of the payments due each month on your Vanquis Visa credit card account. You will be able to specify the amounts - which can be fixed or variable or a combination of the two - to be collected from your payment account along with the date those payments are to be collected (which should be no later than the date by which your payments should reach your Vanquis Visa credit card account in each month). You can also set up a CPA at any time after your Vanquis Visa credit card account is opened.

- We will collect payments of the specified amount using your CPA until you tell us to stop which you can do by calling or writing to us. You can also cancel your CPA by telling your payment account provider. If you cancel your CPA, you will still have to pay at least your minimum payment due by the payment due date. Details of other ways you can make payments on your account can be found here.

- If there is not enough money in your payment account and we are unable to collect the payment under the CPA we will try to take it once more, within the next 7 days. If we are unable to collect a payment under the CPA we will advise you of this.

- If you fail to make your minimum payment by the payment due date you will be charged a £12 fee. You should keep your CPA under review. As the balance on your Vanquis Visa credit card account and your minimum payment due change, you may need to revise the amount we may collect under it or make additional payments to your account so as to avoid incurring late payment charges on your Vanquis Visa credit card account.

Right To Withdraw

- You have the right to withdraw from your Vanquis Visa credit card agreement for any reason within 15 days of the day you received a copy of the credit card agreement as made or the day we write to tell you that the agreement has been made in the same terms as the copy of the unsigned agreement we gave you earlier. You can tell us you are withdrawing from your agreement by phone or in writing. If you withdraw from the agreement, you will need to repay any credit you have used plus interest within 30 days after you tell us you want to withdraw. Interest will be charged for each day between the credit being drawn down and repaid.

- If you don’t withdraw from your agreement, you’ll continue to be bound by the terms of the credit agreement you signed.

- You’ll always have the right to close your account. You will need to repay all the money you owe us under it.

PRE

Pre-Contract Credit Information

(Standard European Consumer Credit Information – SECCI)

 

1. Contact details
 

Creditor.	Vanquis Bank Limited
Address.	No. 1 Godwin Street, Bradford, West Yorkshire BD1 2SU
Web address.	https://www.vanquis.co.uk/
 

2. Key features of the credit product
 

The type of credit
The total amount of credit.

This means the amount of credit to be provided under the proposed credit agreement or the credit limit.	We will set your credit limit when we open your account and will tell you what it is. We reserve the right to vary the limit.
How and when credit would be provided.	We will provide you with credit by letting you use your card and security details to make purchases, cash advances (including money transfers) and/or balance transfer transactions on your account.
The duration of the credit agreement.	This agreement has no fixed or minimum duration.
Repayments	You will have to make a repayment each month. Your statement will show the minimum payment you have to make that month and when you have to make it. The general rule is that the minimum payment will be the higher of:- 

1. any interest we have charged since the date of your last statement; and any default fees we have charged; and the following percentage of the remainder of the balance you owe on your account as at the statement date:
3% if the interest rates you pay are from tiers 11 to 13: or
2.5% if the interest rates you pay are from tiers 1 to 10; or

2. £10 

In every case you must pay off the outstanding balance shown on your statement if it is less than £10.
Your repayments will pay off what you owe in the following order.	Where your repayment is not sufficient to pay off the full balance outstanding on your account, your repayment will be applied in the following order to pay off: 

(i) any minimum payment or instalment plan payment not paid by its due date; 

(ii) any instalment plan payment due for the current month; 

(iii) your main balance starting with the part bearing the highest rate of interest and then in reducing interest rate order; 

(iv) any remaining instalment plan balance; and 

(v) any recent transactions not yet shown on your statement in reducing interest rate order.
The total amount you will have to pay.

This means the amount you have borrowed plus interest and other costs.	Representative example:
Total amount payable: £1137.25
Purchase annual interest rate 28.50% (variable);
Amount of credit £1000;
Representative 28.5% APR (variable).

The calculation of the total amount payable by you under the agreement has been based on the statutory assumptions that: you use the whole of a £1000 credit limit in making a purchase at the date of the agreement; it is repaid in full by twelve equal monthly instalments with interest charged on the remaining balance owing each month at the relevant purchase interest rate; there is no change in the purchase interest rate; and you keep to the terms of the agreement and so do we.
 

3. Costs of the credit
The rates of interest which apply to the credit agreement.	The effective annual interest rates applicable to the credit agreement will be from one of tiers 1) to 13) below: 

Tier 1) Purchase annual rate 27.70%, Cash annual rate 27.70%, Balance Transfer annual rate 27.70%; or 
Tier 2) Purchase annual rate 27.90%, Cash annual rate 27.90%, Balance Transfer annual rate 27.90%; or 
Tier 3) Purchase annual rate 28.10%, Cash annual rate 28.10%, Balance Transfer annual rate 28.10%; or 
Tier 4) Purchase annual rate 28.30%, Cash annual rate 28.30%, Balance Transfer annual rate 28.30%; or 
Tier 5) Purchase annual rate 28.50%, Cash annual rate 28.50%, Balance Transfer annual rate 28.50%; or 
Tier 6) Purchase annual rate 28.70%, Cash annual rate 28.70%, Balance Transfer annual rate 28.70%; or 
Tier 7) Purchase annual rate 28.90%, Cash annual rate 28.90%, Balance Transfer annual rate 28.90%; or 
Tier 8) Purchase annual rate 29.10%, Cash annual rate 29.10%, Balance Transfer annual rate 29.10%; or 
Tier 9) Purchase annual rate 29.30%, Cash annual rate 29.30%, Balance Transfer annual rate 29.30%; or 
Tier 10) Purchase annual rate 29.50%, Cash annual rate 29.50%, Balance Transfer annual rate 29.50%; or 
Tier 11) Purchase annual rate 39.94%, Cash annual rate 39.94%, Balance Transfer annual rate 39.94%; or 
Tier 12) Purchase annual rate 49.94%, Cash annual rate 49.94%, Balance Transfer annual rate 49.94%; or 
Tier 13) Purchase annual rate 59.94%, Cash annual rate 59.94%, Balance Transfer annual rate 59.94%. 

Interest is charged on transactions at the relevant interest rate(s) from the date any purchase, cash (including money transfers), and/or balance transfer transaction(s) or any other amount is debited to your account, until repayment in full. Interest is charged each day on the balance on your account at the end of the day and, except in respect of purchase transactions where you have paid off two or more consecutive current statement balances in full (not just the purchase balance) each month, is debited to your account at the end of each statement period. We will add the interest we charge to the outstanding balance on your account at the date of each statement. This means that you will generally pay interest on interest.

If you make a promotional rate transaction, the promotional rate will apply until the end of the promotional period unless you breach the terms of your agreement with us (such as by missing a minimum payment or going over your credit limit) at which point the standard rates set out above or as may be notified to you from time to time will apply. The promotional rate will not be restored to your account, even if you rectify any breach by bringing your account in order.

If you qualify for an introductory offer, the relevant introductory rates will apply to transactions until the end of the introductory period unless you breach the terms of your agreement with us (such as by missing a minimum payment for more than five days or going over your credit limit for more than ten days) at which point the standard rates set out above or as may be notified to you from time to time will apply. The introductory rate will not be restored to your account, even if you rectify any breach by bringing your account in order. 

If in any statement period the interest we would normally charge is less than £1, we will instead charge a flat fee of £1. 

If you pay off your first statement balance in full (not just the purchase balance) you could get up to 28 days’ interest-free credit on purchase transactions. 

You can get up to 56 days’ interest-free credit on purchase transactions provided that you pay off two or more consecutive current statement balances in full (not just the purchase balance) by the payment due dates. 

We may change the interest rates we charge to respond proportionately to: a change in the risk of your breaking your agreement with us; a change beyond our reasonable control in the cost of providing your account to you; a change in the cost to us of funding the provision of credit to you; a change in legal or regulatory requirements or in a code of practice affecting our business; or a change in the cost of complying with any legal or regulatory requirements that apply to us. 

We will give you at least 30 days’ prior written notice of any increase in your interest rates and at least seven days’ notice of any reduction.
Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APR).	Representative 28.5% APR (variable)
This is the total cost expressed as an annual percentage of the total amount of credit.

The APR is there to help you compare different offers.	The APR has been based on the statutory assumptions that: you use the whole of a £1000 credit limit in making a purchase at the date of this agreement; it is repaid in full by twelve equal monthly instalments with interest charged on the remaining balance owing each month at the relevant purchase interest rate; there is no change in the purchase rate; and you keep to the terms of the agreement and so do we.
Related costs
Any other costs deriving from the credit agreement.	If you owe us more than your credit limit at any time during a statement period, a charge of £12 (“over limit fee”). You would also be charged this over limit fee in each subsequent month that your account remains over limit; 

If you move and you do not tell us your new address and we have to trace you we will make a charge of £25 (“tracing fee”). 

We may also charge you a fee to cover any losses or costs (not being losses or costs of a kind which are covered by any of the fees above) which we reasonably incur as a direct result of your breach of this agreement. 

In respect of each cash transaction, we will charge a fee of 3% of the cash transaction amount or £3, whichever is the higher (“cash transaction fee”). 

We will charge a fee of 2.99% of the sterling value of any non-sterling transaction made abroad or in the U.K. (“foreign cash transaction fee”). The exchange rate used to work out the sterling value of the transaction will be set by the card scheme operator (currently VISA) on the date the transaction is processed, which may be different from the date of the actual transaction. Please note that if you or an additional cardholder carry out a transaction which attracts a foreign cash transaction fee, you will also have to pay a cash transaction fee. 

In respect of each money transfer, we will charge a fee of 3% of the amount transferred or £3, whichever is the higher (“money transfer fee”). 

We will charge a fee of £5 to your account for each paper copy statement issued to you upon your request. 

You are currently unable to opt-in to the Repayment Option Plan (“Plan”). We will tell you if this situation changes. When you are able to opt-in, this will entitle you to freeze your account on the occurrence of certain difficult financial circumstances and as long as you are not in breach of the terms and conditions of your account to take one payment holiday and use one ‘lifeline’ every twelve months. If you do opt-in to the Plan, we will charge you one of the following charges: 

If you are in full-time, part-time or temporary employment or are self employed, the cost of the Plan will be charged at the rate of £1.19 per £100 (1.19% per month) of your total monthly statement balance (“plan charge”). This is known as the Full Plan. 

If you are not employed or you are retired, the cost of the Plan will be charged at the rate of £1.09 per £100 (1.09% per month) of your total monthly statement balance (“plan charge”). This is known as the Standard Plan.
Conditions under which the above charges can be changed.	We may change these fees on giving you at least 30 days’ notice and will give you at least seven days’ notice of a reduction in an existing fee.

If you opt-in to the Repayment Option Plan, you must notify us that your financial circumstances have changed (e.g. you become retired) and you need to be moved from the Full Plan to the Standard Plan or from the Standard Plan to the Full Plan. If you do so, you will be moved to the appropriate Plan and you will be charged the appropriate Plan Charge.
Costs in the case of late payments.	In the event of late or missed payments interest will continue to be charged at the relevant rate. If you breach this agreement we may charge you the following fees: 

if we have not received your minimum payment by the payment due date, a fee (“late payment fee”) of £12 will be payable; 

if you pay us by cheque or direct debit but the payment is not honoured, a charge of £12 (“failed payment fee”); and/or 

a fee to cover any losses or costs (not being losses or costs of a kind which are covered by any of the fees above) which we reasonably incur as a direct result of your breach of this agreement. 

We may change any of the above default fees. We will give you at least 30 days’ notice. We will give you at least seven days’ notice of a reduction in an existing default fee.
Consequences of missing payments.	Missing payments could have severe consequences and make it harder for you to get credit. It may also lead us to taking legal action against you. In a serious case this could include us asking a court to make you bankrupt or to make an order allowing us to sell your home to get back the money you owe.
4. Other important legal aspects
Right of withdrawal.	You have the right to withdraw from this agreement without having to give any reason within 15 days of the day: (a) you received a copy of the agreement as made; or (b) we write to tell you that the agreement has been made in the same terms as the copy of the unsigned agreement we gave you earlier.
Early repayment.	You can repay all or part of your outstanding balance early in full or in part at any time.
Consultation with a Credit Reference Agency.	If we decide to reject your credit application on the basis of information received from a credit reference agency, we will, when telling you that your application has been refused, tell you that it has been refused on that basis and give you the details of the credit reference agency we consulted.
Right to a draft credit agreement.	You have the right, upon request, to obtain a copy of the draft credit agreement free of charge, unless at the time of your making that request we are unwilling to proceed to the conclusion of the credit agreement with you.

SECTION A: BASIC TERMS
A1 - How do we provide you with credit?

We provide you with credit by letting you use your card and security details to carry out purchase transactions, cash transactions and balance transfers. More detail on these different types of transactions is given in Table 5 in B1. At your request, we may issue a card to an additional cardholder, in which case they will also be able to use their card and security details to carry out the same kinds of transactions, which will be charged to your account: see B4.

 

A2 - What do you owe under this agreement?

The amount you owe us at any time is made up of:

the amount of the transactions you and any additional cardholder have carried out; and
the interest and any fees we have added to your account balance
less the repayments you have made.

 

A3 - What is your credit limit?

Your credit limit is the maximum amount you are allowed to owe us under this agreement. You must not let the amount you owe us go over the credit limit. If you do, you must repay us the extra immediately. We will also charge an over limit fee as shown in Table 3 in A8.

We will set your credit limit and tell you what it is when we open your account. We can change your credit limit under B16.1. We will notify you of any change we make.

 

A4 - What is your daily cash limit?

Your daily cash limit is the maximum amount you and any additional cardholder can withdraw in cash each day.

We will set your daily cash limit and tell you what it is before the start of the agreement. In the absence of any such notification it will be 20% of your credit limit. We can change your daily cash limit under B16.1. We will notify you of any change we make.

 

A5 - What rates of interest do we charge?

We charge different rates for the different types of transaction you and any additional cardholder can carry out. The purchase rate applies to purchase transactions, the cash rate applies to cash transactions and the balance transfer rate applies to balance transfers. The purchase rate also applies to most of the fees we charge, but some fees bear interest at the cash rate: see B3 for further details.

If you qualify for an introductory offer, we will tell you the introductory rates which will apply to each type of transaction during the introductory period. Please note that if you miss making a minimum payment so that it remains unpaid for more than five days after the payment due date or you go over your credit limit for a period of more than ten days, then in either of these cases, the introductory period will end and the introductory rates will cease to apply and interest will be charged at our standard rates.

After any introductory period, we charge interest at our standard rates unless, as a concession, we allow you to pay interest on any part of your balance at a lower promotional rate: see B2 for further details. Table 2 below shows our current standard rates.

We can vary both the introductory rates (if any) and the standard rates under B16.2.

Table 2 shows both the effective annual rates and, for comparison, the equivalent monthly flat rate (which we use in some of our advertising material). The effective annual rate gives a truer picture of the cost of the credit.

If an instalment plan is in force under B14, we will charge interest at a special fixed rate on the part of your balance you are repaying under the plan (“the instalment plan balance”). We will tell you what the rate will be before the plan comes into force.

 

A6 - The annual percentage rate (APR) and total amount payable

The APR is to help you to compare the cost of our credit card with those available from other firms at the date of this agreement. We use the following assumptions to work out the APR and the total amount payable:

You use up the whole of a £1000 credit limit in making a purchase on the date of this agreement.
The amount you have spent is repaid in full by twelve equal monthly instalments with interest charged on the remaining balance owing each month at the relevant purchase rate.
There is no change in the purchase rate.
You keep to the terms of this agreement and so do we.
On these assumptions the APR and the total amount payable for each tier is:

Tier	Total amount payable
1 - 27.7% APR (variable)	£1133.80
2 - 27.9% APR (variable)	£1134.66
3 - 28.1% APR (variable)	£1135.53
4 - 28.3% APR (variable)	£1136.39
5 - 28.5% APR (variable)	£1137.25
6 - 28.7% APR (variable)	£1138.11
7 - 28.9% APR (variable)	£1138.98
8 - 29.1% APR (variable)	£1139.83
9 - 29.3% APR (variable)	£1140.69
10 - 29.5% APR (variable)	£1141.54
11 - 39.9% APR (variable)	£1184.59
12 - 49.9% APR (variable)	£1223.15
13 - 59.9% APR (variable)	£1259.42
 

A7 - How much do you have to pay each month?

Unless there is no money owing on your account, we will send you a statement each month showing the minimum payment you must make and the date by which you must make it (this is known as “the payment due date”). The general rule is that the minimum payment will be the total of:

(a) the interest we have charged since the date of your last statement;

(b) any default fees we have charged; and

(c) the following percentage of the remainder of the balance you owe on the statement date:

3% if the interest rates you pay are from tiers 11 to 13; or
2.5% if the interest rates you pay are from tiers 1 to 10.
The exceptions to this rule are that:

If the total of the above amounts comes to less than £10, your minimum payment will instead be £10 (or the whole balance shown in the statement if that is less than £10).
If an instalment plan is in force under B14, you will have to pay each month’s instalment plan payment by the payment due date in that month but we will ignore the instalment plan balance when working out the minimum payment for the remainder of your balance (“the main balance”). Your statement will show both the minimum payment for the main balance and the instalment plan payment under the instalment plan.
If a repayment option plan is in force, you may be able to miss or postpone one or more of your minimum payments and any instalment plan payments. See B20 for further details.
We can change the minimum payment under B16.3.

If you have not made the full minimum payment you were due to make in an earlier month, the amount left unpaid will remain immediately payable. If you have not paid that amount by the time we prepare your monthly statement for the current month, we will include it as part of the minimum payment you must pay that month. You must also immediately pay us any amount you owe above the credit limit.

WARNING: Missing payments could make it harder for you to get credit. It may also lead to us taking legal action against you. In a serious case, this could include asking a court to make you bankrupt or to make an order allowing us to sell your home to get back the money you owe.

We recommend that you should aim to pay more than the minimum payment in each month, since this will clear your balance sooner so you will pay less interest. We may set a recommended payment as a guide to how much you should pay, and, if we do this, we will tell you the amount we have set.

However, you are free to pay more than any recommended amount we set, up to the full balance shown on your statement.

 

A8 - What fees do we charge?

We charge fees (known as “default fees”) where you break this agreement and other fees (known as “servicing fees”) for maintaining your account and providing you with services in connection with it. Table 3 below shows the amount of our default fees and when we charge them. Table 4 gives the same information for our servicing fees.

We charge interest on fees. The interest rate which applies to our default fees and to the servicing fees in Part 1 of Table 4 is the purchase rate. The interest rate which applies to the servicing fees in Part 2 of Table 4 is the cash rate. B3 gives more information on this.

We can vary the default fees and servicing fees we charge under B16.4.

Table 3: Default fees

Name of fee	Amount	When the fee is charged
Late payment fee	£12	If we haven’t received your minimum payment by the payment due date
Over limit fee	£12	If you owe us more than your credit limit at any time during a statement period
Failed payment fee	£12	If you pay us by cheque or direct debit but the payment is not honoured
Tracing fee	£25	If you don’t tell us your new address when you move and we have to trace you
We may also charge you a fee to cover any losses or costs (not being losses or costs of a kind which are covered by any of the fees listed in the above table) which we reasonably incur as a direct result of your breaking this agreement. These include our own administrative costs of dealing with the breach as well as any costs we have to pay to other people, such as fees charged by a collection agency or a firm of solicitors.

Table 4: Servicing fees

Name of fee	Amount	When the fee is charged
Part 1: servicing fees which attract interest at the purchase rate
Foreign purchase transaction fee	2.99% of the sterling value of the transaction**	When you or an additional cardholder carry out a purchase transaction abroad
Copy statement fee†	£5	When you ask for a paper copy of a monthly statement
Part 2: servicing fees which attract interest at the cash rate
Cash transaction fee	3% of the amount of a cash transaction or £3 (whichever is the higher)	When you or any additional cardholder carry out a cash transaction (other than a money transfer)
Foreign cash transaction fee	2.99% of the sterling value of the transaction**	When you or an additional cardholder carry out a cash transaction abroad or a non-sterling cash transaction in the UK
Money transfer fee	3.00% of the amount transferred or £3 (whichever is the higher)	When we carry out a money transfer requested by you or an additional cardholder
** The exchange rate used to work out the sterling value of the transaction will be set by the card scheme operator on the date the transaction is processed, which may be different from the date of the transaction. Please note: If you or an additional cardholder carry out a transaction which attracts a foreign cash transaction fee you will also have to pay a cash transaction fee.

† This fee does not apply if you need copies of your monthly statements in a non-standard format, such as braille, large print or audio.

 

A9 - How long does this agreement last?

The agreement has no fixed end date and will last until it is ended by you or us under B19.

 

A10 - Your right to withdraw from this agreement

You can withdraw from this agreement within 15 days of:

the day you received a copy of the agreement as made, or
the day we write to tell you that the agreement has been made in the same terms as the copy of the unsigned agreement we gave you earlier.
You do not have to give any reason for withdrawing from this agreement but, if you want to withdraw, you must tell us either by writing to or telephoning our customer service department, using the contact details given at the end of this agreement.

If you withdraw from this agreement, you will have to repay any credit you have used together with interest from the date when we provided the credit until the date you repay it. You will have to repay without delay but no later than 30 days after you tell us you want to withdraw. If you ask us, we will tell you without delay how much interest is payable per day.

 

A11 - Claims for unsatisfactory goods or services bought with your card

If you use your card or security details to pay for goods or services costing between £100 and £30,000 for a single item, you may have a claim against us as well as (or instead of) the supplier if the goods or services are unsatisfactory.

For your information:

Please note that you can only have a claim against us if you use your card or security details to pay for the goods or services directly. There will be no claim against us if, for example, you pay for them:

with cash that you have withdrawn using your card; or
with money that you have asked us to transfer to your personal bank account.
 

SECTION B: FURTHER TERMS
B1 - What kinds of transaction can you carry out with your card?

Details of the kinds of transaction that you and any additional cardholder can carry out under this agreement are shown in Table 5 below. Please remember that you must make sure that neither you nor any additional cardholder carries out a transaction which would lead to the total amount you owe us going over your credit limit.

Table 5: The transactions you can carry out

Type of transaction	What it covers
Purchase transactions	Paying for goods or services	Paying for goods or services. This can either be a one-off payment to the retailer selling the goods or services. Or it can be a permission (known as a “continuous payment authority”) for the retailer to take regular payments from your credit card account, for example, to pay for a magazine subscription. 
Remember that, if you or an additional cardholder give a retailer a permission of this kind, you can ask us to cancel it at any time.
Paying the repayment option plan charge	Paying the monthly charges due to us under B20 if and so long as you are opted in to the repayment option plan.
Cash transactions	Cash withdrawals	Withdrawing cash from a cash machine or from a financial institution displaying the sign of the card scheme operator (e.g. VISA or Mastercard). The cash which you and any additional cardholder withdraw on any one day must not exceed your daily cash limit.
Foreign currency transactions	Carrying out a non-sterling cash transaction in the UK or withdrawing foreign currency from a cash machine or financial institution outside the UK.
Purchasing foreign currency	Making a sterling payment to purchase foreign currency or travellers cheques.
Money transfers	Asking us to transfer money to your personal bank account or an additional cardholder’s personal bank account or to a third party’s bank account. You may ask us to transfer money to a third party’s bank account either on a single occasion, or at regular intervals during a fixed or open-ended period.
Gambling transactions	Paying to take part in any form of gambling (e.g. gaming, betting or buying lottery tickets) or to make a purchase at a gambling establishment (e.g. buying drinks at a casino).
Balance transfers	Paying off some or all of the balance that you or an additional cardholder owe on a credit card account with another provider.
 

B2 - Interest rates: introductory, standard and promotional rates

If you still qualify for an introductory offer, the introductory rates will continue to apply instead of our standard rates during the introductory period.

As a concession, we may from time to time give you the benefit of a lower, promotional rate on particular transactions for a set promotional period. We will tell you if you qualify for a concession of this kind and, if you do, we will also advise you at the same time of anything which is likely to lead us to withdraw the concession before the end of the promotional period (such as missing a minimum payment or going over your credit limit). Once the promotional period ends (or if the concession is withdrawn before then), interest will again be charged at the relevant standard rate. The restrictions on changing interest rates in B16.2 will not apply in these circumstances.

 

B3 - How do we charge interest?

When we refer in this agreement to the “purchase rate”, the “cash rate” or the “balance transfer rate”, we mean the introductory, standard or promotional rate which for the time being applies to purchase transactions, cash transactions and balance transfers.

Please note that these rates do not apply to any part of your balance which you are repaying under an instalment plan. We will tell you what rate will apply to the instalment plan balance before the plan comes into force. See B14 for further details.

We charge interest at the purchase rate on the following items (“the purchase balance”):

purchase transactions;
default fees; and
servicing fees shown in Part 1 of Table 4 in A8.
We charge interest at the cash rate on the following items:

cash transactions; and
servicing fees shown in Part 2 of Table 4 in A8.
We charge interest at the balance transfer rate on any balance owing under a credit card agreement with another provider that you or any additional cardholder transfer to your account with us.

The general rule we apply in charging interest is as follows:

Each time you or an additional cardholder carry out a transaction or we charge a fee, we charge interest on the amount of the transaction or fee from the date we add it to your account balance until it is fully repaid.
We charge interest each day on your account balance at the end of the day.
The daily interest we charge on each part of your account balance will be added to that part of the balance on the next statement date (unless you have paid it before that date). This means we will charge you interest on that interest for as long as it remains unpaid.
There are some exceptions to the general rule:

First, we do not charge any interest on a purchase balance if you pay us the whole of your main balance shown on the statement (not just the purchase balance) by the payment due day and you also paid off the whole of the main balance shown in your last statement by the payment due date. (If you have an instalment plan, you do not need to pay off the whole of the instalment plan balance in order to avoid paying interest on the purchase balance.)
Secondly, we don’t charge interest on a default fee for the first 28 days after we gave you notice that you have to pay the fee. After that, we will charge simple interest on the fee for as long as it remains unpaid, but you will not have to pay interest on the interest we’ve charged on the fee.
Thirdly, if the interest we would normally charge in a statement period is less than £1, we will instead charge a flat fee of £1.
Fourthly, if an account freeze is in force under a repayment option plan, we will not charge interest on your main balance or on any instalment plan balance; see B20.5 for further details.
If you are late making a minimum payment, or miss it altogether, we will continue charging interest at the same interest rates. However, you will have to pay a late payment fee (see Table 3 in A8).

 

B4 - Issuing a card to you and any additional cardholder

When we have opened your account, we will send you a card and personal identification number (“PIN”).

At your request, we may also issue a card and PIN to an additional cardholder. The following terms will apply if you ask us to do this:

You will need to supply us with the additional cardholder’s details but you must get their consent before doing this. You must also make sure that they are at least 18 years old and resident in the United Kingdom.
You must make sure that the additional cardholder uses their card in accordance with this agreement.
We cannot control how the additional cardholder uses their card. You will be responsible for repaying the amount of any transactions carried out by an additional cardholder together with any interest and fees we charge on them. However, we will not hold you responsible for a transaction which it would have been reasonable for you to expect that we would refuse to carry out under B11.1 (a) or (b) or under B11.2 (a) or (b).
You can ask us to cancel an additional cardholder’s card at any time but you will remain responsible for its use until it is returned to us.
That additional cardholder has no right to enforce any term of this agreement under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
Each card we issue may only be used by the person whose name is on it. You must contact us to activate your card and any additional cardholder must do the same to activate their card. The card can only be used between the “valid from” and “expires end” dates shown on the card.

 

B5 - How are transactions authorised?

We can only charge a transaction to your account if you or an additional cardholder have authorised the transaction (either directly or through a PISP).

A purchase transaction may be authorised:

by using the card or security details or both (for example, inserting the card into a card reader and entering the PIN, or by using the card details to make a purchase online or by telephone);
by holding a contactless card in front of a contactless card reader;
by providing a retailer with the card details and giving the retailer permission (known as a “continuous payment authority”) to take regular payments from your credit card account, for example, to pay for a magazine subscription.
A cash transaction may be authorised in the following ways:

a cash withdrawal may be authorised by inserting the card into a cash machine and entering the PIN;
a foreign currency transaction or gambling transaction may be authorised by using the card or security details;
a money transfer may be authorised by telling us the amount to be transferred and supplying us with your security details.
A balance transfer may be authorised by telling us the amount to be transferred (this will be the amount owing on another credit card account which you or an additional cardholder want to transfer to your account with us) and supplying us with your security details.

A transaction may also be authorised by following any other security procedure which we tell you has become available for a transaction of that kind as a result of developments in technology (for instance, the use of biometric data such as a fingerprint or iris scan).

The following terms apply where a transaction has been authorised through a PISP:

(a) Immediately after we receive the PISP’s instructions to carry out the transaction, we will provide or make available to the PISP all information on the initiation of the transaction and all information accessible to us regarding the carrying out of the transaction.

(b) We will treat the instruction in the same way as an instruction received directly from you, unless we have objective reasons for treating it differently.

(c) We may deny the PISP access to your account on reasonably justified and duly evidenced grounds relating to unauthorised or fraudulent access to your account by the PISP. Unless it would compromise reasonably justified security measures or would be unlawful:

we will tell you about any denial of access to the PISP using any of the contact details we hold for you;
we will tell you before we deny access if possible, or otherwise immediately afterwards.
 

B6 - Asking us to transfer money to another bank account

There are some cases in which we will need to transfer money to another bank account in order to carry out our obligations under this agreement. These cases are:

where you authorise us to make a money transfer to your personal bank account;
where your account with us is in credit and you ask us to transfer the credit balance to your personal bank account;
where you or an additional cardholder authorise us to make a balance transfer (when we will need to transfer money to another credit card provider to reduce or pay off the amount you owe them).
To enable us to transfer the money, you or the additional cardholder must tell us the sort code and account number of the account the money is to go to, the account name and the date when the transfer is to be made. The general rule is that the money will arrive no later than the next business day after we receive this information. The exceptions to this rule are that:

if we receive the information after 3.00 pm on a business day, or on a day which is not a business day, we will treat the information as received on the next business day, which means that the money may not arrive until the business day after that;
if you or the additional cardholder have told us that the transfer is not to be made until a later day, the money will arrive on that day (or, if that day is not a business day, on the next business day).
If you or the additional cardholder give us the wrong payment details (e.g. where the sort code or account number are incorrect), we will not be responsible if the money goes astray. We will make reasonable efforts to recover the money but may charge you for any reasonable costs we incur in doing so.

If we were instructed to make the payment by a PISP, we will refund the amount of the transaction to you if it was not carried out or carried out incorrectly and will return your account to the position it would have been in if the amount refunded had never been charged to your account (for example, by refunding any interest or fees we have charged as a result).

 

B7 - Can you cancel a transaction after you’ve authorised it?

If you or an additional cardholder have authorised a transaction which is due to be carried out a future date (for example, if you have given a retailer a continuous payment authority to take regular payments from your account), you can cancel the transaction by contacting us no later than close of business on the business day before the transaction is due to be carried out. If the transaction involves a third party (e.g. a retailer), you should also contact them before the transaction is due to be carried out to tell them that you have cancelled it.

You cannot cancel any other transaction after you or an additional cardholder have authorised it. So, for example, you cannot cancel a cash withdrawal or a purchase transaction where the retailer has provided the goods or services at the time of payment.

 

B8 - When will we give you a refund for a transaction you’ve authorised?

If you or an additional cardholder have authorised a money transfer or balance transfer and have given us the correct payment details to transfer the money:

we will promptly refund the money if we cannot prove that it arrived on time;
we will return your account to the position it would have been in if the amount refunded had never been charged to your account (for example, by refunding any interest or fees we have charged as a result); and
if you ask us to, we will make immediate efforts to trace the money and will notify you of the outcome.
We will also refund the full amount of a transaction authorised by you or an additional cardholder where all of the following conditions are met in full:

(a) the exact amount to be paid was not stated (e.g. because you authorised a hotel to take whatever you spent during your stay from your account);

(b) the amount actually paid was more than the amount you could reasonably have expected in the circumstances (including your previous spending patterns, but disregarding exchange rate changes);

(c) the person receiving the payment was using a bank or other institution located in the European Economic Area (the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) to provide them with payment services; and

(d) you ask us for a refund within eight weeks of the payment being taken from your account.

You must provide us with any information we reasonably need to check whether the conditions in (a) and (b) above have been met. Where you are entitled to a refund, we will provide it within 10 business days of you requesting it or within 10 business days of receiving the information we’ve asked you to provide.

 

B9 - Keeping your card and security details safe

You must take all reasonable precautions to keep your card and security details safe. You must also make sure that any additional cardholder takes the same precautions to keep their card and security details safe. This includes:

signing the card as soon as it is received;
keeping the card secure;
memorising the PIN and keeping it secret by shredding or otherwise destroying the paper slip the PIN is written on and not writing it down or recording it in such a way in a way that it might be recognised as a PIN;
not changing the PIN to one that is obvious;
not allowing anyone else to use the card;
not allowing anyone else to use your security details apart from an AISP or a PISP and then only to the extent needed to enable them to provide the services they have agreed to supply to you.
 

B10 - What happens if your card or security details are stolen, lost or misused?

You must call us immediately on the number shown below if:

you suspect that someone else knows your PIN or an additional cardholder’s PIN;
you lose your card or suspect that it has been stolen;
an additional cardholder loses their card or suspects that it has been stolen; or
you suspect that someone has carried out an unauthorised transaction on your account, or may try to do so.
TO REPORT THE THEFT, LOSS OR SUSPECTED MISUSE OF A CARD, CALL US IMMEDIATELY ON 0800 783 9003 (OR +44 161 444 4495 IF CALLING FROM OUTSIDE THE UK).

You can also contact us by writing to Vanquis Card, Customer Service, P.O. Box 399, Chatham, ME4 4WQ.

If we become aware of suspected or actual fraud or security threats relating to your card or security details, or those of an additional cardholder, we will attempt to contact you by telephone (using the number you have given us) or via our mobile app or by sending you a text message or e-mail asking you to contact us. Provided that you satisfactorily complete the security checks we use to verify your identity, then (to the extent permitted by law) we will inform you of the nature of the suspected or actual fraud or security threats.

We will promptly investigate any transaction you challenge as unauthorised, or which we suspect to be unauthorised. You must co-operate with us and the police in carrying out these investigations and in attempting to recover any losses arising from the theft, loss or misuse of your card or security details.

If our investigations confirm that the transaction was not authorised by you or an additional cardholder, the general rule is that we will refund the transaction and return your account to the position it would have been in if the amount refunded had never been charged to your account (for example, by refunding any interest or fees we have charged as a result). The general rule applies in every case where:

the card or security details are misused before you or an additional cardholder received the card; or
the card or security details are misused to carry out a transaction where the cardholder does not have to be present (such as buying goods online or over telephone).
However, in other cases, there is an exception to the general rule. This is that, until you report the theft, loss or suspected misuse of the card, you will be responsible for:

all losses caused by the misuse of the card by someone who got possession of it with your consent; and
the first £50 of losses caused by the misuse of the card by anyone else.
 

B11 - When may we refuse to carry out a transaction, or stop you using your card?

B11.1 - We may refuse to carry out a transaction if:

(a) you already owe more than your credit limit or would do if the transaction went ahead;

(b) the transaction is a cash withdrawal and your daily cash limit has already been exceeded or would be if the withdrawal went ahead;

(c) the transaction appears unusual compared to how you or an additional cardholder normally use the card.

B11.2 - We may also refuse to carry out a transaction or, if it is reasonable, put a temporary or permanent stop on you or any additional cardholder using the card or its security details:

(a) to protect the security of the card or your account;

(b) to stop the card or its security details being used fraudulently or for other criminal or illegal purposes;

(c) to reflect or prevent a significant increase in the risk that you may not be able to pay us what you owe;

(d) if we reasonably believe that the information you gave us in your application is untrue;

(e) if we are unable to contact you;

(f) if you or an additional cardholder have told us that the card is lost or stolen or that someone else knows the security details;

(g) if:

at all times during the preceding period of 36 months the amount you owe under this agreement has exceeded £200;
the payments you have made during that period have repaid less in principal than they have paid in interest and fees;
we contact you to provide you with options for increasing your payments to repay the amount you owe more quickly and in a way that does not adversely affect your financial situation (for example, by transferring all or part of your balance to an instalment plan under B14); and
you do not respond within a reasonable period specified by us to confirm either that you will increase your payments in accordance with one of the options we have offered or that the options are not sustainable for you, or you state that you will not make the increased payments after confirming that they are sustainable;
(h) if you or we have given notice to end this agreement under B19.

B11.3 - If we take any of the steps described in B11.1 or 11.2, you will be informed about them in the following ways:

We will tell you if we refuse to carry out a balance transfer or a money transfer and, unless prevented by law, will explain why we are doing so.
For other kinds of transactions, you will normally find that we have refused to carry out the transaction when a retailer asks for payment by another method or a cash machine will not dispense the cash. In these cases, you can ask for an explanation from our customer service department using the contact details given at the end of this agreement. We will give you our reasons unless prevented by law.
We will normally give you notice before (or, if that is not possible, immediately after) we put a temporary or permanent stop on the use of a card and will give our reasons for doing so. However, we will not give notice where prevented by law from doing so, or where the giving of notice would be likely to prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the administration of justice.
In a case where B11.2 allows us to put a temporary or permanent stop on the use of a card, we may ask you to return the card to us (in which case, you must return it immediately) or we may ask a retailer to keep the card and return it to us. We will allow you to start using your card again, or replace it with a new card, if and when the reasons for stopping its use cease to apply.

If you or an additional cardholder use a card for a criminal or illegal transaction, we may require you to reimburse us or the operator of the card scheme for any loss which we or they suffer as a result.

 

B12 - Providing you or an AISP with information about your account

B12.1 - Monthly statements

We will send you a statement each month if there has been any activity on your account or if there is any money owing on your account at the statement date.

We will send your statement to the last postal address you have given us unless you have opted to receive your statements electronically, in which case we will send it to the latest electronic address which you have given us in a form which you can store for future reference.

Your statement will contain details of all transactions, interest and fees charged to your account during the period covered by the statement, together with details of all payments and refunds credited to your account during the same period. If you think that anything shown in your statement is incorrect, you should tell use immediately by contacting our customer service department using the contact details given at the end of this agreement. You should also tell us if you do not receive your statement.

B12.2 - When may we provide an AISP with information about your account?

The following terms apply if you are using an AISP:

(a) We will treat a data request from the AISP in the same way as a data request received directly from you, unless we have objective reasons for treating it differently.

(b) We may deny the AISP access to your account on reasonably justified and duly evidenced grounds relating to unauthorised or fraudulent access to your account by the AISP. Unless it would compromise reasonably justified security measures or would be unlawful:

we will tell you about any denial of access to the AISP using any of the contact details we hold for you;
we will tell you before we deny access if possible, or otherwise immediately afterwards.
 

B13 - Making payments to us under this agreement

You are responsible for paying us the amount of all transactions charged to your account under this agreement, together with the interest and fees we charge.

Except where there is no money owing on your account, you must make the following payments on or before the payment due date in every month (unless a repayment option plan allows you to miss or postpone the payments under B20.5, 20.7 or 20.8):

the instalment plan payment under any instalment plan; and
at least the minimum payment due on your main balance.
You must pay us even if you do not receive a monthly statement showing the amount due. If this happens, you can find out how much you need to pay either by contacting our customer service department using the contact details given at the end of this agreement or by checking your account online or using the Vanquis mobile app.

You are free to pay more than the minimum payment each month and we recommend that you do this. You may pay any amount up to the full balance owing on your account, but you should not pay more than this as it will put your account into credit. We will not pay any interest on any credit balance.

All payments must be made in pounds sterling. Where the money is transferred electronically, the transfer must from a UK bank or building society. Where the payment is by cheque:

the cheque must be drawn on a UK bank or building society; and
the cheque must be made payable to “Vanquis Bank”, followed by the number of your Vanquis Visa Card account, and your name and account number should also be written clearly on the back.
Alternatively, we may ask you to make payments under this agreement by setting up a continuous payment authority (or ‘CPA’) when the agreement is made. You can also set up a CPA yourself at any time after your account is opened. Setting up a CPA means that you give us details of your debit card and we use those details (or the details of any replacement debit card you register with us) to take regular payments from your bank account to pay money you owe us under this agreement.

The following terms will apply to any CPA you set up to make payments to us under this agreement:

(a) You set the amount which you want us to take from your bank account. This can be a fixed sum or a variable amount (for example, your minimum payment or the full balance you owe us each month) or a combination of the two (for example, your minimum payment plus £10). If the amount you set is or includes a fixed sum, then:

if the set amount is more than the full balance you owe us, we will limit the amount we take to the balance you owe;
if the set amount is not enough to pay the minimum payment and any instalment plan payments by your payment due date, you will need to pay the shortfall in some other way.
(b) You set the frequency of the payments we take and you choose the date when we take them. The date you choose may either be a fixed day of the month or the payment due date:

If you choose a fixed date, we will take the payment on the same date in every month (even if it is not a business day) unless the month does not have a day corresponding to the fixed date (e.g. where the date is the 31st and the month only has 30 days), in which case we take the payment on the first day of the following month. You should set the fixed date so that the payment reaches us by your payment due date.
If you choose the payment due date, the date will normally fall around 25 days after the statement date in every month.
(c) If there is not enough money in your bank account to enable us to take a payment on the date you have set, we will make a second attempt to take the payment within the next seven days. If there are arrears of a previous month’s minimum payment owing on your account, that second attempt may be to take a reduced payment, which will be equal to the minimum payment due including those arrears. If we are still unable to take the payment, we will treat the CPA as having been cancelled by you. We will write to tell you if this happens and you will either need to set up a new CPA or else find another way to make future payments, making sure that you pay us at least the minimum payment and any instalment plan payment by the payment due date in every month.

(d) You can cancel your CPA at any time either by contacting our customer service department using the contact details given at the end of this agreement or by telling the bank or building society where you have your bank account. If you cancel your CPA, you will still have to pay us at least the minimum payment, together with any instalment plan payment, by the payment due date in each month.

Other ways in which you make payments to us under this agreement can be found at www.vanquis.co.uk/faq or on the back of your account statement.

We will credit a payment to your account when we receive it. When a payment is credited to your account, it will reduce the balance you owe on your account. Please note, however, that, if you make a payment by cheque, we may need to wait until the cheque has cleared before we can treat the payment as increasing the credit available to you under this agreement. You should allow seven working days for a cheque to clear.

You may have a claim against a retailer if you have used your card or security details to pay for goods or services and the retailer does not keep to their side of the bargain (e.g. because the goods or services are not delivered or are of poor quality). You cannot normally use your claim against the retailer as a reason for not making payments to us under this agreement. However, in the cases mentioned in A11, you may have a claim (under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974) against us as well as the retailer, and you may then be able to use your claim against us as a reason for not making payments to us under this agreement (but only to the extent that the payments you owe us do not exceed the amount of your claim against us).

B14 - Instalment plans

B14.1 - General

Where an instalment plan applies:

we will charge interest on the instalment plan balance (this is the part of your balance that we transfer to the plan) at a fixed rate of interest, which may be preceded by a lower introductory fixed rate;
you must repay the instalment plan balance with interest making the monthly instalment plan payments over a fixed term.
B14.2 - How is an instalment plan set up?

We may transfer any part of your balance to an instalment plan at any time. However, we will not exercise this power unless:

we have first told you what the terms of the plan would be (including the amount we are willing to transfer to the plan, the duration of the plan, the interest rate we will charge under it, the amount of the instalment plan payments and any fee we will charge for setting up the plan); and
you have told us that you wish the transfer to go ahead.
Once we have made the transfer, you must keep to the terms of the plan for as long as it remains in force.

B14.3 - When will the plan end?

The general rule is that the instalment plan will remain in force until the end of the fixed term we have set. There are two exceptions to this rule.

First, the plan will end early if, before the end of the fixed term:

you repay the whole of the instalment plan balance, together with any interest which has become due on it but remains unpaid at the date when you repay;
you ask us to cancel the plan;
we give you notice cancelling the plan because you have not paid the instalment plan payments for two months in a row; or
you or we end this agreement.
If the plan ends but this agreement continues, then (unless the terms of the plan provide otherwise) any part of the instalment plan balance which remains unpaid will be combined with your purchase balance for the purpose of charging interest and working out the minimum payment.

Secondly, the term of the instalment plan will be extended if a repayment option plan is in force and either:

we freeze your account under B20.5 so that your obligation to make the instalment plan payments, and our right to charge interest on the instalment plan balance, are both suspended while the account remains frozen; or
you take a payment holiday under B20.7 so that you are relieved from your obligation to make an instalment plan payment (but not from your obligation to pay interest on the instalment plan balance) during the payment holiday.
B14.4 - When we may need to change your instalment plan payments because a repayment option plan applies

If you take a payment holiday under B20.7, the instalment plan payments we set at the start of the instalment plan will not cover the interest we charge on the instalment plan balance during the payment holiday. Similarly, if we provide you with a lifeline under B20.8, the payments we set at the start of the instalment plan will not cover the interest we charge on the instalment plan balance during any period when the lifeline permits you to delay payment of an instalment plan payment. In either of these cases, we may either increase the instalment plan payment by the amount necessary to ensure that the outstanding interest is repaid with interest by the end of the term for the instalment plan, or extend the term of the plan to enable the outstanding interest to be repaid by the current instalment plan payments. If we opt to increase the instalment plan payment, we will notify you of the increased payment not less than 14 days before the payment due date on which the first increased payment is payable. If we opt to extend the term of the plan, we will notify you of the extended term not later than 14 days before the original term was due to expire.

 

B15 - How do we use the payments you make?

If the amount you pay in a month is less than the full balance you owe, we will use your payment to reduce the different parts of your balance in the following order:

first, to pay any minimum payment or instalment plan payment that was not paid by its payment due date;
next, to pay any instalment plan payment for the current month;
next, to reduce or pay off your main balance (your statement balance less any instalment plan balance), starting with the part which bears the highest rate of interest and so on in reducing interest rate order;
next, to reduce any remaining instalment plan balance;
lastly, to reduce or pay off any recent transactions not yet shown on your statement, again starting with the transactions which bear the highest rate of interest and so on in reducing interest rate order.
 

B16 - When may we make changes under this agreement?

As this agreement has no fixed end date, we may need to make changes to it to take account of changes affecting our business or changes affecting your financial status. If you are unhappy with any changes we make, you may end the agreement straightaway by giving us notice under B19 that you want to end it and repaying what you owe us.

B16.1 - Changes to the credit limit and daily cash limit

We will keep your credit limit and daily cash limit under review and may change either or both of them from time to time to respond proportionately to:

a change in the risk of your breaking this agreement, having regard to how you have been running your account;
a change in your financial status; or
a change in the value of money.
We may also make a proportionate reduction in your credit limit if your account balance has remained substantially below the current credit limit over a sustained period.

The general rule is that we will give you at least 30 days’ notice if we are proposing to increase your credit limit or daily cash limit, in which case the increase will apply to you at the end of that period unless you have contacted us in the meantime to reject it or request a smaller increase.

There are some exceptions to the general rule:

If you ask us to, we will not implement any future proposals to increase your credit limit or daily cash limit unless you contact us during the period of our notice to tell us that you wish us to do so.
We will stop proposing any further increases in your credit limit or daily cash limit if you contact us at any time to ask us to do so.
In an emergency (for example, if you are stranded abroad), we may, at your request, grant you a temporary increase in your credit limit and daily cash limit with immediate effect. An increase granted in these circumstances will be limited to a set period, which we will tell you at the time of your request. You must make sure that, at the end of the set period, the amount you owe under this agreement does not exceed the credit limit which applied immediately before the temporary increase took effect.
If we notify you that you are eligible for a balance transfer, we may also propose that, if you ask us to go ahead with the balance transfer, your credit limit will be increased by any amount up to the amount of the balance transferred. Unless you reject the increase we have proposed, the increase in your credit limit will take effect when the balance transfer is completed. If for any reason the transfer does not go ahead, your credit limit will remain unchanged.
WARNING: A higher credit limit may offer greater flexibility and convenience to meet your financial needs. However, it may also increase the risk of taking on too much debt, which may be costly, or take a long time to pay off. You should carefully consider whether you need a higher limit.

We will normally give you at least 30 days’ notice of a reduction in your credit limit or daily cash limit.

However, we may reduce your credit limit or daily cash limit without notice (in which case we will tell you about the reduction as soon as possible afterwards) where:

we reasonably think that the reduction is needed to stop you carrying out further transactions that would increase your account balance to an amount that you cannot afford to repay; or
there is a substantial change for the worse in your financial status or your ability to afford the payments you must make to us under this agreement; or
we need to make the reduction to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
You may ask us to reduce your credit limit or daily cash limit at any time. However, we will not reduce your credit limit to a level which we reasonably believe would cause you to break this agreement (e.g. if the reduction you have asked for would take the credit limit below your account balance).

B16.2 - Changes to interest rates

We will not change any fixed rate of interest which applies under an instalment plan. We may from time to time change any of the other rates of interest we charge to respond proportionately to:

a change in the risk of your breaking this agreement, having regard to:
- whether, on two or more occasions during the last 12 months, you have been more than five days late in making any payment that you were due to make under this agreement;

- any change in your credit score; and

- any information we obtain from credit reference agencies on how you are meeting your financial commitments;

a change beyond our reasonable control in the cost of providing your account;
a change in the cost to us of funding the provision of credit under this agreement;
a change in legal or regulatory requirements or in any code of practice affecting our business; or
a change in the cost to us of complying with any legal or regulatory requirements that apply to us (but excluding any additional costs we have to bear as a result of a failure by us to comply with those requirements).
We will give you at least 30 days’ notice of any increase in your interest rates and at least seven days’ notice of any reduction.

If we give you notice of an increase in your interest rates, you will have 60 days, starting with the date when you receive the notice, in which to tell us that you reject the increase. If you do this, the increase will not apply to you but:

no further card transactions may be carried out by you or any additional cardholder;
you must cancel any continuous payment authorities you have given to enable someone else to take regular payments from your account;
you must repay all the money you owe under this agreement within a reasonable period;
this agreement will end and your account will be closed when all the money you owe has been repaid.
B16.3 - Changes to the minimum payment

We may from time to time change how we set the minimum payment to respond proportionately to:

a change in legal or regulatory requirements or in any code of practice affecting our business;
a decision by a court or ombudsman; or
to reflect good practice in the provision of banking and financial services.
We will give you at least 30 days’ notice of any change in the way we set the minimum payment.

B16.4 - Changes to the fees we charge

We may from time to time change the fees we charge for the reasons given below. Some of the reasons are specific to particular fees while others are common to all of them. We set out the specific reasons first and then the common reasons.

Default fees: We may change the default fees listed in Table 3 in A8 to reflect a change in the average costs or losses we reasonably expect to incur as a result of the breach which causes the fee to become payable.

Money transfer fees: We may change the money transfer fee shown in Part 2 of Table 4 in A8 to respond proportionately to a change in the risk of your breaking this agreement, having regard to:

your payment history;
any change in your credit score; and
any information we obtain from credit reference agencies on how you are meeting your financial commitments;
Servicing fees: We may change any of the servicing fees we charge (including the money transfer fee) to respond proportionately to a change beyond our reasonable control in the cost of supplying the service covered by the fee.

All fees: We may change any of the fees we charge under this agreement to respond proportionately to:

a change in the value of money; or
a change in the law or any code of practice affecting our business.
We also may introduce a new servicing fee to reflect in a proportionate manner the costs we reasonably incur in providing a new service or facility which we make available to you under this agreement.

We will give you at least 30 days’ notice of any increase in an existing fee or the introduction of a new servicing fee. We will give you at least seven days’ notice of a reduction in an existing fee.

B16.5 - Changes to your card

We may from time to time replace your card with a new card having the same features (for example, when your current card is about to expire or is wearing out).

We may also issue a replacement card which has different features and may have a different number from your current card. We may do this where:

we are replacing the card with one which has equivalent or superior features (for example, where the new card is issued under a different card scheme);
we need to change the features of the card to reflect a change in the terms that apply to the card (being a change which we are entitled to make by exercising our powers under this agreement);
we need to remove a feature which is available with your current card because the feature gives rise to security risks or is supported by technology which has become obsolete or is being withdrawn by a third party;
there is a change beyond our reasonable control in our relationship with a third party who has been providing features available with the current card; or
you have asked us to switch you to a different credit card product.
We will give you at least 30 days’ notice before we replace your card with one which has different features except where we are doing so because you have asked us to switch you to a different credit card product.

We may change your account number or card number (or both) if we reasonably think the change is needed to protect the security of your account or card (for example, if you tell us your card has been lost or stolen or you suspect that your account details or security details are being misused, or if you have not received a replacement card that we have sent you). We may make these changes without notifying you first, though we will try to contact you beforehand where we can do so without putting the security of your account at risk. If we need to change your card number, we will issue you with a replacement card with the new number.

If you have given anyone a continuous payment authority to take regular payments from your credit card account, you will need to tell them if we change your account number or card number so that they can continue to take payments from your account.

B16.6 - Changes to the other terms of this agreement

We may from time to time make changes to the other terms of this agreement for any one or more of the following reasons:

if the change is in your favour;
to correct an error;
to make the terms easier for you to understand;
to reflect a change beyond our reasonable control in the operation of the card scheme we use in connection with your account;
to enable us to offer you a new service or feature in connection with your account;
to reflect improvements in the systems we use to run our business (including changes in the capabilities of those systems) or other changes to those systems which are beyond our reasonable control;
to reflect changes in technology, fraud prevention requirements or payment methods;
to reflect changes beyond our reasonable control in the costs of providing the services we supply to you;
to reflect a change which has occurred or we reasonably expect to occur in the near future in legal or regulatory requirements or in the requirements of any trade body that apply to us;
to reflect the requirements of any code of practice which promotes good practice in the financial services sector.
We will ensure that any change we make to the terms of this agreement is a proportionate response to the reason relied on for making the change.

We will give you at least 30 days’ notice of any change we make to the terms of this agreement, except that, where the change is in your favour, we may make it on giving you not less than seven days’ notice.

 

B17 - Things you need to tell us

You must tell us tell us immediately if:

you change your name or address;
you change your telephone or mobile number or your e-mail address;
you move overseas permanently;
your statement includes any information that you think is wrong.
You should also tell us promptly if your financial circumstances change.

You can tell us about these changes by contacting our customer service department using the contact details given at the end of this agreement.

Remember that:

you also need to call us immediately if your card or security details (or those of an additional cardholder) are lost, stolen or misused: see B10;
if you fail to tell us about a change in your address, you may have to pay a tracing fee (see Table 3 in A8)
 

B18 - Transferring this agreement

You cannot transfer this agreement or your rights and duties under it.

We may transfer this agreement, or any of our rights and duties under if, to another person (“the transferee”) if:

the transferee is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority or the Financial Services Authority and has permission from Financial Services Authority to exercise the lender’s rights under agreements regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
we have first agreed a statement of policy with the transferee under which they agree to exercise the rights and powers transferred in a way that is no less favourable to you than the way in which we have been exercising them before the transfer.
We will arrange for notice of the transfer to be given to you as soon as reasonably possible after the transfer. However, if there is no change so far as you are concerned in the arrangements for administering this agreement following the transfer, we do need to give you notice of the transfer until those arrangements are changed in a way which affects you.

 

B19 - Ending this agreement

You can give us notice at any time that you wish to end this agreement. The notice should be given by contacting your customer service department using the contact details given at the end of this agreement.

We may end this agreement at any time by giving you not less than two months’ notice.

We can also give you notice ending this agreement immediately in the following cases:

(a) you have broken this agreement regularly or seriously;

(b) you die;

(c) a bankruptcy order, debt relief order or similar order relating to personal insolvency is made against you or you enter into an individual voluntary arrangement;

(d) we are unable to contact you;

(e) we have put a permanent stop on you using your card under B11.2.

We will only give you notice to end this agreement for the reason given in (a) above if we have first given you a default notice under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the default notice has expired without you having remedied the breach (if it was capable of being remedied).

If you or we have given notice to end this agreement:

you must stop using your card or security details to carry out any further transactions;
you must ensure that any additional cardholder stops using their card or security details to carry out further transactions;
you must repay all the money you owe us, including the amount of any transactions which do not appear on your account until after the notice has been given;
you must cancel any continuous payment authorities you have given to enable someone else to take regular payments from your account.
The agreement will not end formally until you have repaid all the money you owe us under it.

If your account is in credit when this agreement ends, we reserve the right not to repay you any amount less than £5 due to the administrative costs of making the payment.

 

B20 - The repayment option plan

B20.1 - General

The following terms apply to you if you were opted-in to the repayment option plan on 19 April 2016 and have remained opted-in to the plan at all times since then.

If these terms apply to you:

You must pay us a monthly plan charge, which will be calculated and payable in accordance with B20.3.
You will be entitled, subject to the terms and conditions set out below, to receive all the features of the plan whether you are in full-time, part-time or temporary employment, are self-employed, or are unemployed or retired. However, the situations in which your account may be frozen (a ‘difficult financial circumstance’ as described in B20.5 - 20.6 below) will depend on your employment status.
The repayment option plan is not a regulated insurance product and will not pay off any capital or interest on your account.

We do not provide advice or a recommendation on whether the plan is suitable for your purposes.

B20.2 - Opting-in to the repayment option plan

The repayment option plan is currently unavailable to customers who are not already opted-in to it. We will tell you if this situation changes and it becomes possible for customers who are not currently opted-in to the plan to opt-in to it in the future.

B20.3 - Cost of the repayment option plan

B20.3.1 - The cost of the repayment option plan depends on your personal circumstances.

B20.3.2 - If you are in full-time, part-time or temporary employment or are self-employed, the cost will be charged at the rate of £1.19 per £100 (1.19% per month) of the total monthly balance shown on your statement (‘the full plan charge’). This is known as the Full Plan.

B20.3.3 - If you are not employed (as described in B.20.3.2) or you are retired, the cost will be charged at the rate of £1.09 per £100 (1.09% per month) of the total monthly balance shown on your statement (‘the standard plan charge’). This is known as the Standard Plan.

B20.3.4 - We will charge the full or standard plan charge directly to your account each month as a purchase transaction. The full or standard plan charge will accrue interest in the same way as other purchase transactions.

B20.4 - Features of the repayment option plan

B20.4.1 - If you have opted-in to the repayment option plan, in return for the full or standard plan fee but subject to the terms and conditions set out below, we agree:

in the event of a difficult financial circumstance (as defined below to ‘freeze’ your account (as described in B20.5.2) subject to the terms set out in B20.5.1 and B20.5.3 - 20.5.5 and B20.6;
to allow you to take a ‘payment holiday’ (as described in B20.7.1) subject to the terms set out in B20.7.2 - B20.7.4;
to provide you with a ‘lifeline’ (as described in B20.8.2) subject to the terms set out in B20.8.1 and B20.8.3 - 20.8.4.
B20.4.2 - If you wish to freeze your account or take a payment holiday you must call the plan helpline on 0330 099 3010*. The plan helpline is available between 8am and 8pm Monday to Friday and 9am to 5.30pm on Saturday.*

B20.5 - Freezing your account

B20.5.1 - We agree that if you experience a difficult financial circumstance (as defined below) and you request us to freeze your account by telephoning the plan helpline in accordance with B20.4.2, we will, subject to the terms and conditions set out below, freeze your account for as long as the difficult financial circumstance continues to apply, up to a maximum period of 24 months per event (or series of connected events).

B20.5.2 - If we freeze your account in accordance with the terms of the repayment option plan that means that:

you will not be able to use your card or account;
we will not charge you interest on any outstanding balance under your account;
you will not be obliged to make any payments under this agreement (though, if you wish, you can make voluntary payments to reduce the balance owing on your account);
you will not be liable to pay any fees;
you will not be liable to pay the full or standard plan charge;
we will contact you at least every six months to review your individual circumstances while your account remains frozen.
B20.5.3 - After the difficult financial circumstance ceases to apply or after 24 months (whichever is sooner), you will be able to use your card or account but interest will accrue again and you will be obliged to continue your payments under this agreement and pay any applicable fees that accrue on the account.

B20.5.4 - We will only freeze your account if you provide us with reasonable evidence to show you first experienced the difficult financial circumstance after you opted in to the plan. You must also continue to supply us, on request by us, with reasonable evidence of the continuation of the difficult financial circumstance at any time while your account is frozen. If you do not do so, we may terminate the freezing of your account.

B20.5.5 - You agree that if you wish us to freeze your account as a result of any difficult financial circumstance and you have notified us within 90 days of its first occurrence and provided us with reasonable evidence as required under B20.5.4, any freezing of your account will be backdated to the date of the first occurrence of that difficult financial circumstance. Where first notification of such difficult financial circumstance is made more than 90 days after its first occurrence and you have provided us with reasonable evidence as required under B20.5.4, any freezing of your account will be backdated to the date of notification of that difficult financial circumstance.

B20.6 - Difficult financial circumstance

In relation to both the standard plan and the full plan ‘difficult financial circumstance’ means the occurrence of one of the events listed below or the occurrence of more than one of the events listed below in a series of connected events:

you become sick, disabled or have an accident which affects your ability to make your repayments; or
you have to stay in hospital because of a medical condition; or
you have to attend jury service; or
your main home is significantly damaged by a natural disaster e.g., flooding; or
your partner (who you have lived with for more than 6 months) or an immediate family member (sibling, parent, spouse or child) dies;
and in relation to the full plan ‘difficult financial circumstance’ means also:

you become unemployed involuntarily (other than as a result of your own misconduct or by reason of your retirement) or by reason of redundancy including non-compulsory redundancy; or
you are put on short-time working or laid-off reducing your usual weekly hours of work by 20% or more; or
you are self-employed and have suffered a reduction in weekly income by 20% or more through loss or non-renewal of contracts or work; or
you take leave from work to care for a partner (who you have lived with for more than 6 months) or a member of your immediate family (sibling, parent, spouse or child) and suffer loss of income; or
you go on maternity, paternity or adoption leave.
B20.7 - Payment holiday

B20.7.1 - A payment holiday means that you will not be obliged to make your next minimum payment and any instalment plan payment on the payment due date.

B20.7.2 - We agree that we will allow you to take a payment holiday under the terms of the repayment option plan if:-

you have not taken a payment holiday on your account which allowed you to miss making the last minimum payment (and, if applicable, the last instalment plan payment) on your account; and
a lifeline has not been used in respect of either of the last two minimum payments (and, if applicable, either of the last two instalment plan payments) on your account; and
you have not already taken a payment holiday at any time in the current account year; and
your account is not and has not at any time within the last two months been subject to a payment arrangement agreed with us under which you have made repayments lower than those which would have been due under the terms and conditions of your account; and
your account is not frozen under the repayment option plan in accordance with B20.5 and B20.6; and
you are not in breach of the terms and conditions of your account.
B20.7.3 - If you wish to take a payment holiday and are eligible under B20.7.2, you must contact us to request it before midday on the day of your payment due date or, if that day falls on a non-working day, you must contact us to request it before midday on the last working day before that non-working day. If you do so and you are eligible for a payment holiday we will allow you to miss making the minimum payment on the payment due date.

B20.7.4 - During a payment holiday:

interest will continue to accrue on your account and will not be suspended;
you will remain liable to pay your usual full or standard plan charge; and
you will also continue to be liable for all fees, apart from any over limit fee that you would otherwise have had to pay as a result of not paying the minimum payment and any instalment plan payment that the payment holiday allowed you to miss.
B20.8 - Lifeline

B20.8.1 - We agree that if you do not make your minimum payment and any instalment plan on your account by the payment due date we will provide a lifeline on your account if:-

you have not taken a payment holiday on your account which allowed you to miss making either of the two last minimum payments (and, if applicable, either of the last two instalment plan payments) on your account; and
your account is not and has not at any time within the last two months been subject to a payment arrangement agreed with us under which you have made repayments lower than those which would have been due under the terms and conditions of your account; and
you have not already had a lifeline provided on your account at any time in the current account year; and
a lifeline has not been provided in respect of the last minimum payment (and, if applicable, the last instalment plan payment) on your account; and
your account is not frozen under the repayment option plan in accordance with B20.5 and B20.6; and
you are not in breach of the terms and conditions of your account.
B20.8.2 - If you are eligible for a lifeline on your account, that means that we will:

(a) notify you by SMS message and letter that we have provided you with a lifeline on your account;

(b) suspend your account so that you will not be able to use your card or account until we have received the minimum payment and any instalment plan payment which you have not paid;

(c) suspend your obligation to make your minimum payment and any instalment plan payment (to which the lifeline relates) on the payment due date in accordance with the terms of B20.8.3 below;

(d) waive or refund any late payment fee or over limit fee that you would have had to pay, as a result of your failure to make the minimum payment and any instalment plan payment, if the lifeline had not been provided to you; and

(e) subject to you meeting your obligations under B20.8.3, report your account as ‘current’ when we next report the performance of your account to credit reference agencies.

B20.8.3 - Following the provision of a lifeline, you must pay the minimum payment and any instalment plan payment you have missed and to which the lifeline applies before the next payment due date on your account. If you do this, the suspension of your account under B20.8.2(b) will cease as from the next working day following the date the payment reaches your account. If you fail to do this and you also fail to make the next minimum payment (together, if applicable, with the next instalment plan payment) on your account by the applicable payment due date, the suspension of your account will continue and we will report to credit reference agencies that you have missed those payments.

B20.8.4 - While your account is suspended following the provision of a lifeline:

interest will continue to accrue on your account;
you will remain liable to pay your usual full or standard plan charge; and
you will also continue to be liable for all fees apart from those which have been specifically waived or refunded under B20.8.2(d).
B20.9 - Opting-out of or changing the repayment option plan

B20.9.1 - You must notify us by calling 0330 099 3010* if your financial circumstances change after opting-in to the repayment option plan (e.g., you become retired) and you need to be moved from the full plan to the standard plan or from the standard plan to the full plan. If you do notify us you will be moved to the appropriate plan and you will be charged the appropriate repayment option plan charge.

B20.9.2 - You can opt-out of the repayment option plan at any time. If you opt-out of the plan within 30 days of receiving the information on the plan and the plan has commenced, you will receive a refund of the plan charge (if any) charged to your account. If you wish to opt-out of the plan you can do so by contacting our customer service department using the contact details given at the end of this agreement.

B20.9.3 - We may remove you from the repayment option plan at any time by giving you 30 days’ written notice. We may remove you from the plan immediately if, acting reasonably, we believe the plan is being misused by you.

B23 - Complaints

If you have a complaint about the service we provide, please write to our customer service department at the address given at the end of this agreement. We can provide you with a copy of our internal complaints handling procedure on request, or you can find it via the ‘contact us’ page of our website, www.vanquis.co.uk/contact-us. If we cannot resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, you can refer it to the Financial Ombudsman Service by writing to them at Exchange Tower, London E14 9SR, telephoning them on 0800 023 4 567 or filling in the online complaint form on their website (www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/).

To encourage the use of online dispute resolution (ODR), there is an ODR platform created by the EU Commission which allows consumers to submit their complaint through a central site which will forward the complaint to an appropriate alternative dispute resolution scheme. In this case it would be the Financial Ombudsman Service. You can also contact the Financial Ombudsman Service directly using the contact details given above.
