Focus on something for the next 2hrs. Here are your near-term objectives:

YouTube Caption Search
Neighbourhood Watch -> Cams -> Solar
Order BSFL and a shed.
Setup Tinkerbricks demo and website

NOT:
TUTU2, etc.
AR Book
Green Line Story Podcasts - Higher bandwidth 2 mimnute papers name on tin

BUT:
Focus on the money

Ted told me something relevant about Trail Cams - the need for 2 and the mini panic-buy after it was deemed to work in catching a local celebrity - I should potentially find the article and then seek to tap into the same trend

I did another thing yesterday besides Yang.md, I listed the honda on fb, and verified the arrival of the CEDR cheque - Miranda told me something relevant about running a flight claim delay enterprise - have a minimum threshold to make it worth the time. Would I take the £20 payment upfront? I _could_ do that and sell it on. Need access to the delayed flights and passenger contact details. £20 now or £50 after (after you get your compensation money).
