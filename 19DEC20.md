Focus on something for the next 2hrs. Here are your near-term objectives:

YouTube Caption Search
Neighbourhood Watch -> Cams -> Solar
Order BSFL and a shed.
Setup Tinkerbricks demo and website

NOT:
TUTU2, etc.
AR Book
Green Line Story Podcasts - Higher bandwidth 2 mimnute papers name on tin

BUT:
Focus on the money

Ted told me something relevant about Trail Cams - the need for 2 and the mini panic-buy after it was deemed to work in catching a local celebrity - I should potentially find the article and then seek to tap into the same trend

I did another thing yesterday besides Yang.md, I listed the honda on fb, and verified the arrival of the CEDR cheque - Miranda told me something relevant about running a flight claim delay enterprise - have a minimum threshold to make it worth the time. Would I take the £20 payment upfront? I _could_ do that and sell it on. Need access to the delayed flights and passenger contact details. £20 now or £50 after (after you get your compensation money).

So basically this is also on the list --> but there is another aspect to think about --> the Neighbourhood watch is a mini-market place so it does include things like: CEDR claims, Contract Release, Language tutoring.

Focus on the structure and design.

What makes a good programmer?

Just take a second out to acknowledge that I love this process, despite the fact it is completely open source and I am potentially opening up the world to reviewing my ramblings. Masking my ramblings should not be defensible enough - and if I clean up my act and operation there is potentially a linear paper trail for others to follw shoulf thry want to contribute to the band wagon.

In fact - this easily *could* be a wiki => just that everything and all links are inserted by hand. I don't pay anything to run this accept the annual domain name fees, and anyone can fork the repository in order to make changes and then pull request which i would review. Imagine if *actual* wikipedia was setup in this way LOL.
