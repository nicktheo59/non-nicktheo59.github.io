Madonna talked about not wanting to be PPPedestrian, well this 2017 iMAC always takes like a million years to do anything (even to save a basic text file), my 2011 Windows 7 Toshiba is literally rapid in a side by side comparison (include benchmark PICS).

##On my non-core activities

I have certain obsessions, aside from wanting to achieve the 5 things i have mapped to my fingers, namely: BSFL; AR Book; Auto-S; TBricks; Solar (in reverse order)

I will pay someone to market my inventions and simply measure their progress. 

...mapped to my fingers... I want to attain the ability to construct a Trundel Wheel generator that ultilises the motion of water spinning inside it; I would be interested to construct a shallow stream generator also; 

That is my main motivation for wanting to re-learn physics and mechanics - or at the very least it is a target to aim for and keep in mind. 
The other motivation is to develop a proof for one of the Millienium problems (or at least be able to contribute and comprehend ideas). I lean towards addressing the Yang-Mills mass gap problem and/or the Navier-Stokes proofs - because of my background study and because I believe I have an original idea for each of them.

Namely, 2D N-S goes infinite at a sharp point because you need to invoke a line surface that does not exist i.e. in 3D you have the line surface above and below the point but in 2D it is just a point as hence a solution is not valid. 

###Yang-Mills

For Yang-Mills I barely have a handle on the problem (it's to do with the form of a solution equation that makes the Strong force drop-off at nucleus length scales but can maintain the infinite range of the residual Electromagnetic force)

My idea is to do with re-developing everything from a radial charge-centric world (instead of position-time-mass orientatied) and most importantly re-formulating QM and the schrodinger equation for a complex 4D geometry (2 of space and 2i of time) - when I was learning this stuff I got attached to the fact that the Wave equation bore resemblance to E=C^2 M but in this analogy Energy would have to be the 2nd differential of time (and it could be 2 complex time dimensions at that). Mass would have to be the 2nd differential of displacement over position (and somehow links in with the binding energy [per nucleon]). For a laugh around that time, the following year, I derived an equation analogously by using Schrodinger's exact methods - but I flipped the dimensions he used and enforced 1 of space and 2 of time (real at that).

But now I know that Yang-Mills is formulated as a set of matrix equations (tensors) - but they 'mysteriously' can't be formulated in a 3D + 1 Time standard Mass gap equation - the reason is that when you multiply Matricies together they are obscuring the underlying / symmetric complex time elements. The thing is loop quantum gravity researchers are trying to do away with the notion of 'time' on small length scales.

There's something else which says energy is not conserved over Universe-age time scales = and it is too ugly to reformulate everything so that energy is once again 100% convserved.
The other thing is my original 'naive' schrodinger equation may be very applicible to photons / light since the question 'what is waving' remains an open one ever since the Michelson-Morely experiment but to bed the notion of needing a medium in which to propagate as a wave. Under my theory we now know that the propagation medium is 2D complex time - it might explain reflection (-1) and polarisation (90degree phase shift). Also it is clear that photons are themselves 1D propagators in space while their presence can influence the Electromagnetic field and their path is guided by the curvature of space-time ( thus introducing relativistic contraints) - it is clear they do not influence the curvature of their own path (no mass) nor are they disrupted by charges that they encounter since they are chargeless. But simply they talk to electrons. At this moment I would go as far to say they are two sides of the same coin. It is claimed that an anti-electron looks exactly like a regular electron prograting backwards through time.
My claim is there are waves of possibilities interating with mass-ive and charge-full particles of determanism, and ironically it is the long range theory of Gravity that looks most smooth and wave-like, while the wave-crests of possiblity are emerging as events of erratic particle determanism.

The only 2 space dimensions we needbe concerned with are 'down' or scale (where repeating patterns may emerge to form chains of geometric marvels for gravity) and 'out' (and radially would make the most sense for that). There are finite constituents (which is where we ge the emergence of depth) and there 'point-like' disturbances that are in motion (space and complex time) - our measurments are crude and pin them down in this 2D space realm - because of the earlier depth construct we get Quanta. 

But at this point my unknown open question is whether it will be necessary to involve another riddle of re-formulating Electroweak unification in order to re-cast it in 2+2i D constraints to make the rest of the theory work?

I've made no mention of neutrinos yet - what are they.

This could explain the decay probabilitiy of neutrons. 
I don't know if a possible proton decay would make sense at this point (in Standard model it is longer than the age of the universe.)

Another question is that do photons begat electrons or do electrons begat photons? As in - can we find primordial photons that never interacted with electrons because certain quantum states of electrons are not allowed (and hence they cannot 'catch' these photons?). Should these photons still be reflected? If so - can we find them and perhaps trace the hubble expansion line from them??

***
Another thing I just realised about why this idea could make sense is that the mapping of the time component in Four-vectors for special relativity is -1 (i.e. i * i).
What is the best way to express 3 spatial dimensions as 2, using radial / sphereical units? I seems like it could be more natural. There is however an open question about mapping volumes perfectly between spheres and cubes in higher dimensional spaces.
