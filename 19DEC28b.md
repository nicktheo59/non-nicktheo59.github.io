Skeleton / Framework for my daily working habits and routines
=> The staple activities

Automatic re-linking of files, class names, variables, functions, routes etc. would make sense and save labour when refactoring / renaming code (non value-add labour at that)

Could I setup up:
3D Shop? Persona Play framework, angular client etc. ? (Update for any security patches (?)
The other bit of code was - Michael Zooniverse's job description builder

Sivers's advice for learning javascript - head first into HTML 5,,, what else?

Pipelines with a Scraper / Selenium running as a cron job on Colab, possibly on Paperspace for more processing power.

Python - virtual environments, that LiveOverflow guide and more modern library mentioned at the end.

Trademarking - Auto-Shares (without the hypen?, not necessary since Google only asserted TM for some reason that I forgot? Involving shrewd Larry Page)

Patenting - TUTU, Wider one for what3 words technique? or not worth the money at this stage right now. Put it in the plan maybe?

Measuring Momentum - but not obsessing on systems, just EAT THE DAMN FROG.

2 hour work windows (with preemptive completion criteria) is a very reasonable objective.

Make a master list once again one more time? Here it is, man:
- Weekly snapshot updates on Dropbox Paper nikipedia
- Trello incremental, experimental trello board groups i.e. "Batch 22 - 24" &  
- 80/20 everything
- Language Club & EulerPy & Blinkist / skim read - unaided self-generative OBS video or written recall 

In these coming 2 hours I will:
- Override my urges to procrastinate
- Tackle the big bad frog
- Pick a 3d 4-piece jigsaw to represent Auto-Shares, N-Squad, BSFL, Tinkerbricks.
	- Green, Red, Blue, Purple

Wasted my life making a picture again...
