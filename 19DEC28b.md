Skeleton / Framework for my daily working habits and routines
=> The staple activities

Automatic re-linking of files, class names, variables, functions, routes etc. would make sense and save labour when refactoring / renaming code (non value-add labour at that)

Could I setup up:
3D Shop? Persona Play framework, angular client etc. ? (Update for any security patches (?)
The other bit of code was - Michael Zooniverse's job description builder

Sivers's advice for learning javascript - head first into HTML 5,,, what else?

Pipelines with a Scraper / Selenium running as a cron job on Colab, possibly on Paperspace for more processing power.

Python - virtual environments, that LiveOverflow guide and more modern library mentioned at the end.

Trademarking - Auto-Shares (without the hypen?, not necessary since Google only asserted TM for some reason that I forgot? Involving shrewd Larry Page)

Patenting - TUTU, Wider one for what3 words technique? or not worth the money at this stage right now. Put it in the plan maybe?

Measuring Momentum - but not obsessing on systems, just EAT THE DAMN FROG.

2 hour work windows (with preemptive completion criteria) is a very reasonable objective.

Make a master list once again one more time? Here it is, man:
- Weekly snapshot updates on Dropbox Paper nikipedia
- Trello incremental, experimental trello board groups i.e. "Batch 22 - 24" &  
- 80/20 everything
- Language Club & EulerPy & Blinkist / skim read - unaided self-generative OBS video or written recall 

In these coming 2 hours I will:
- Override my urges to procrastinate
- Tackle the big bad frog
- Pick a 3d 4-piece jigsaw to represent Auto-Shares, N-Squad, BSFL, Tinkerbricks.
	- Green, Red, Blue, Purple

Wasted my life making a picture again...

An imaginary concept for an Audacious Technologies 'investor day' on 20th Jan 2020

Wanted to convey this jigsaw idea to help the pieces meld together for onlookers.

Auto-Shares & 
Cyprus Solar club &
TinkerBricks &
Feed our future - BSFL.

Would Good to Go be a good partner to attract prospective commercial partners.
Completely forgot about the Veolia commercial bins proposition. 

They charge £11 per week. And 6.5p per Kg. And 13p per Kg over 70 Kg per week (per week or per month?).
Probably per collection each Thursday. And 5p per day for renting the bin. That's £18.25 per year.
Down from £200-odd was it per month? 



Wasted even more time on twitter raving about Veolia and my council contract connection, 
the plausibility to convert Tilt brush files into USDZ with Reality Composer?
And stupidly a Windows phone come-back conspiracy. Foldable Surface Phone.

Anything else that was actually worth my while?@?@

Oh yeah some mentioning of Google Tez .. no that was earlier

Yup it was 40 minutes just on those 3 tweets. 

I guess the Veolia thing was a necessary step for my to make in order to sear into my commercial awareness. 
But you aren't going to get anywhere near €25bn with this kind of low-level fart tweeting killer time sink.

It is almost 10pm :(

Either break down expenses / Tax tasks
OR design AND implement a short video explainer of A-S, TB, ....... N-Squad......, BSFL
Learn to make a USDZ and embed it in an Apple Book .... NOT now but on the list.
OR Model the value chain processing of BSFL / Feed our Future at the same system level that you would do for Subway.
	In particular pay attention to the reproduction cycle i.e. containment techniques, as well as investigate 
	any potential dried / portable / hibernation state .. oregeano packing machine .... and post-conversion / post-growth Flour 
	Milling or pelletising process. Basically get insider knowledge of EntoCycle's process. For a start understand what Ento refers to.
	What was industrial and academic the background of the main founder(s)?

Also why? Why I know it will be a potentially huge opportunity that is too big for one company to exclusively steer our destiny towards.
Like how Huel seized on Soyent for the UK market, now with pro biotics (and great flavours / niche market alternatives).
The other thing is I would like to research the chemical composition of the final protein feed product (for both poultry and fish)
- as a function of the types of waste food that you feed it. Why are EntoCycle focusing purely on coffee grounds etc. Is that already enough to make a difference to our food supply chain AND it is a 'clean' source of nourishment for the Larvae. (There is simply No need to complicate things further e.g. with co-conversion processes such as [some] chicken faeces? or potentially spoilt/slightly more hazardous food.
How do Cardiff Council currently ultilise/recycle the food caddy waste (i.e. what do the current contractors do with it?)
And finally (after all those avenues) - is there a potential opening for a food caddy proposion for use within the Redditch council district.
How does the market share of [food] waste disposal look across the 649(?) councils? And how does the commercial waste disposal market look (with and without BSFL) in comparision to the residental market - - tendering.
