In the process of re-building / porting things over from 

[Auto-shares.com](https://auto-shares.com)
<!-- {:target="_blank"} -->

(Bit slow to load)

Even though there are sub-brands to better help distinct customer segment identify with the product variation for their market
I've decided to brand _everything_ with the Auto-Shares brush. Make things simpler for every one.

This means the following will eventually be absorbed and become product names:

Solar Club
360Caravan
Tinkerbricks VR
Addback Ads
BSFL
Auto-Shares Pensions
VendHawk
TillHawk

I do understand that these loose and esoteric referrals to semi-baked products may raise more questions than they answer... I agree with you. ^^
