### Project Ideas Unprioritised:

- Write a Selenium script to visit TweetDemo.com every 3 minutes and post my referral link http://bit.ly/cheaper-hosting-provider

- Add a feature to my TweetDemo that lets you login to Twitter and then posts your profile URL.

- Pick something specific from WebKid Data Visualisation and Interactive Map projects

- Use Dash Plotly for something specfic that I'm interested in, maybe ONS data?

# My Prioritised Weekly coding challenge queue:

- Projects with a Video tutorial:
  - Visual Twitter - Learn about Mash ups, APIs.
  - Maze Game - Learn about Firebase, Serverless Microservices, maybe Cloud functions.
  - Will Kwan's SaaS template - StartBootstrap, connect the Stripe API to business logic in the App. 

- Ideas of my own:
  - Re-do my Webkid news site - Ghost CMS, More experience with hosting and deployment options

  -Learn how to lazy load images and resize images appropiately depending on the screen size.
  - Do this with the PWA Starter Kit

### More Like Thinking Out Loud:

- I would like to implement an API compatible with the Book Search front-end
  - This will become the basis for the **Real** Nikipedia.
  - There should be an image - preferably, drawn by me, to encompass the learning item
    - Also there would be a TFIDF search function, and preferably a random article on the home page
    - Audio would also be nice to enhance recall thanks to multi-media encoding
    - Just for kicks it would be able to generate comprehension Questions from read text (and answer them)
    - You Would also be able to upload target docments and data sources (like LinkedIn and legal contracts; these are all all text based for now)

    - Another 'wish list' item is that there would be a "search youTube captions" mode, perhaps audio would need to be scraped and transcribed; but that would require alot of pre-processing (perhaps unnecessarily, and it is certainly impossible to catchup with the rate of YouTube uploads) -- it might be better to provide a Playlist link, it then processes 1% and provides you a remaining time estimate (maybe you setup web push notifications to know when this part is done). Once the Captions are transcribed there is an 'output link' where you would do the Querying - 
    there may also need to be an option to clean up the transcription - although if it gets to that I would rather make all the Preparing of Text a completely separate process and just focus Nikipedia on simple Searching TFIDF, Question-suggesting, and Answer-evidencing (there may be conflicting data in the passages of text). 
    - To simplify the text preparing there would be a Browser Extension similar to Kimonify etc.; Collect, Collect, Submit to Nikipedia, open the text Querying page.
    - 'Collections' of LinkedIn Text data and YouTube Playlist Captions
