##Auto-Shares

Auto-Shares is ultimately a highly disruptive pensions product. We make it easy for car owners to sell fractional ownership of their vehicles [to pensioners] then automatically and securely collect usage payments from car riders/drivers, these "per ride" payments are then distributed to the now _multiple_ car equity holders. Our solar-powered, retrofit, cloud-connected smart system (called TUTU) will ship out of the box with Open Pilot v1.0 - the 'Android' alternative to Tesla's Open pilot. Initially we are focused on highly ultilised commercial vehicles driving a fairly predictable number of business miles per year (leaning towards the financing of prospective new EVs over second-hand Petrol/Diesel). Compared to the typical life-time annuity product, our *3-year-at-a-time* product represents x2.5 times better value -- all the while providing a compelling business case for companies (and eventually individuals) to transistion to "Pay as you go" electric vehicles. Or simply help fleet operators finance for their vehicles in the most flexible way possible, in a way that makes most sense for them and their business.

##Tinkerbricks

Tinkerbricks is a virtual reality where science students can come together and encounter the intricacies of human ingenuity at unprecedented levels of fidelity ("Immersive learning"). 

The business model is to re-create scientific objects as "branded" digital assets.
Distinct from mainstream advertising channels, Tinkerbricks is where the world's greatest companies can attract the mindshare of tomorrow's engineers.
Allocating the "brandable" digital assets and experiences will be decided by regularly holding a competitive auctions between potential corporate sponsors. Winning sponsors will then be able to offer guidance to customise the limited edition asset and learning experience to their liking.

These learning experiences are simply not reprodicible on a classroom white board, and although Tinkerbricks may supplement a teacher-led course of study (and we expect to accelerate attraction of new users/students via teachers voicing support for our learning products), there are some clear advantages to learning science in a virtual environment - with deep implications for teaching:

* *More Visual & Immersive Demonstrations* - virtual experiences enable us with the ability to overlay extra-sensory information _on the objects themselves_ (e.g. 'see' Magnetic Force lines, Voltages, and Currents); 

* *Self-Paced & Adaptive learning* - instead of muddled teacher explanations or momentary classroom distactions, every explanation is replayable and pristine (there could also be a 'hints mode' to turn on or off);

* *Niche & Cost-effective Teaching* (with Software-like margins) - once the best learning experiences have been created by the best educators (for each ability level) we do not need to re-develop it unless there is a new discovery or we want to improve our learning experience to take advantage of new platforms/technologies (like haptics);

* *Safe Learning* - emulate a hazardous environments or situations without risk of physical harm.

The other major opportunity here is that recorded user inputs can be used to demonstrate or validate skills. An 'examination' aspect of the platform may more readily demonstrate the knowledge possessed by final year students who are soon seeking to gain employment - data from successful students would be optionally shared with sponsoring employers to dramatically improve their recruitment cost-effectiveness.
