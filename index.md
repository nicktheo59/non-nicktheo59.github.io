##What is this Nikipedia thing anyway?

Hi, My Name is Nick or Νικόλαος in Greek.
I wanted an easily-accessible place to share my projects and knowledge so I created this open source project.
The idea is this: 
- (Almost) every day I will write/think aloud/plan in a way that feels natural for me.
- Sometimes those writings will be worth 'refactoring' into their own document/project.
- I will polish / present those projects into something more coherent and reader-worthy here, on the first page.
- Finally I will link between documents (html web pages) that I have personally generated in a wiki-like way 
-- To a) to serve as a firm foundation for future generations to also build on top of (you have access to all my thinking out aloud 'threads'.) 
and b) to test my own understanding as I develop personal 'reference documentation'. This project is my personal fight against early-onset Alzheimer's. It is not enough to read and study; you must create and solve.

## Aims
I'm lucky. I got to grow up in the right environment, with the right family, and right education.
I spent my entire waking life orientatied towards one principle, in the same way Chris Hadfield chose to eat is vegetables from age 6 because he believed it would make him more likely to become an astronaut(!).

What I (and feasibly also You) have decided to work on:

- The Future of Energy and Pensions (Solar Club)
- The Future of Education (Tinkerbricks VR/AR)
- The Future of Pensions and Transport (Auto-Shares)
- The Future of Food and Waste Managment (BSFL)

And of course other jobs/contracts/learning projects/activities related to these aims; they are holistic themes that I strive towards -- working to develop Customer Relationship Management software systems (which I have done), or gaining 2-3 years of employment in the AR hardware or VR Training industry, for example, are all necessary and relevant to these Aims.
