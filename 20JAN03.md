Thought in passing about this alot but now I write it into words:
wouldn't it be useful to beginners to Machine Learn from github commit history -- this is what Kite co-piolot does for the purposes of writing Python.. but there is something more to this idea I'm sure.

Flash-point reactions in material science at macroscopic sizes / / I've seen light (photons) move like a fluid at insane frame-rates 

Should I concentrate on looking remotely? what kind of thing.. Or should I focus on a Python/Flask proejct to finally pick that up. Along with Colab stock trading news sentiment (intraday) (price opening) surely some bias inherent from the 'market maker' opening the stock. Volume and Closing prices at a variety of time views also important. Also the idea is to look for fanatical growth opportunities as an incumbent is on the cusp / precipice of disruption -- theses are the data sets for my trading bot -- now to put it into a algorithm that computes price action / finds outliers and enacts on that information over a time period longer than the pro trade bots, but quicker than retail investors --- there needs to be a probability space computed for when to successfully exit a trade. Or otherwise only pick companies which I would hold a long term view of e.g. Tesla.

Seriously I need to get to grips with successful earning potential - not this nonsense. TillHawk and 360 Caravan installations? 
I need some respite to re-invigorate my impetus and agenda. 

I want to go and see Noey.
