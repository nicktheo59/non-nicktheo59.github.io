It's only the truly obsessed who are bestowed the honour of adapting our environment, in the hope that others more sane than themselves will embrace it.

If I list out the 'code word' title for each of my objectives you will get the following:
- Solar
- TinkerBricks
- Auto-Shares
- AR Book
- BSFL
- Caption Search 

Listing this would also conjure random bucket list items I am yet to even consider getting around to:
- The Players film
- Sell a business
- Float or Direct List Audacious
- Design and erect a building from the ground
- Fluency in Greek and Python

That last one I know I have written down more times than I care to wonder about how much actual time I have seriously invested into those endeavours.
Further to _that_ list I would add:
- Revise Physics, in particular mechanics, mathematics, and electrodynamics.
- Better understand Life sciences, and in particular the business of Genetics in the age of CRISPR, Aging / Longeivity, and Brain health.

And finally this thirst for concrete, practical knowledge of these subjects inspires me to not leave out other topics including:
- Philosophy, Plato's Republic
- Material Science
- Satelite applications
