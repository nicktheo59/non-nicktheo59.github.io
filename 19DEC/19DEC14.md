What I want to do and what I gotta do.
1 - Coolant for the car
2 - Clean / Pack / Fridge

3 - I want a live Books App with a different picture / title, published in all the stores, 
Maybe a video Explainer at the beginning instead of a picture. Or a GIF.

4 - I want a live portfolio page not cranky Edison 
5 - I want a weekly update and a plan moving forward
6 - I want to trim my bread

Should I...
I'm compelled to do many things all at once but then when I zone it a couple will dissapear out of focus so then to make any list I commence simply incomplete.

I will bring this Laptop with me If I can.
Otherwise I will need to install Sublime etc. 
Could I think about selling it (it's pretty slow anyway).

I need a consistent working enviroment - I would like Shadow If I had a battery of cash from an iMac sale.
600/30 = 20 Months. Try to get 24.

Complain to 3 that they didn't give me my £40 refund, total of the over pay is __ , I could lodge an offical consumer complaint

Enquire with Crown Insurance about Yaya's claim (I took photo scans of the policy number)

Sell Honda 10i on ebay for no less than £675 then you don't make a loss.

Check SLC balances

Transfer my €1150 odd euros from hsbc currency account to revolut. Withdraw / Spend that locally in Cyprus.

Setup Contract Release Gocardless infrastructure to shift my unneeded 3 contract now.

If I knew Greek well and mastered 'daytime pillow talk' then 2016 would have been different

Python for Finance and Mathematica Widgets for Pension Calculations

I had a tail end of a dream where I got the finances togther to make a cafe work - flush with cash! 330k revenue etc.

Had a good 9 hours - 2.36am - 10.42am/11.42am 
Find a good Remote company like Zapier to learn their internal processes. 

Apps to tell you/remind you what you want to do and make progress - e.g. Reading Lists, Language Drills

Never happened before or since, but my brother once stayed over and I let off a 'top of my lungs' scream in the middle of the night - he was terrified & I barely remembered it!

i DO NOT NEED A READING LIST APP, DO I?

Invidious playlists to be able to lock the home screen.

		Good to meet you!

		I've made the repo public - please find the code here https://github.com/mwalmsley/ai-weekend. You probably want the `audio_streaming.py` file.

		As per the readme, you'll need to install some audio tools, and you'll also need the Google Cloud SDK and a Google Cloud account.

		Hope it works for you! Any troubles, let me know.

Kinda wasted today on preping the Youtube bedtime story idea
Right now I'm trying and failing to run the Books app (Caption Search front-end) as a production build
	Serving it great locally at http://127.0.0.1:8081/ with an alternative home page image (Nikipedia) but 
	How can I host it on a IBM virtual machine etc.
	Would it take a while? I can at least push the latest commits back to my fork of the repo
		Same goes for this github pages daily tracker, 
			Don't know if the same goes for Cranky Edison.
Ultimately I gotta make a Tinkerbricks landing page (with Start Bootstrap or Cranky Edison DatoCMS Gatsby)
	Would be cool to rotate the homepage of Nikipedia with an explainer video (and link/doc text locator)
	Would be cool to have a pattern on upvotes for Tinkbricks content to customise the order of priority for each user

That upvote / priority / spaced repetition / -- feature would be a cool thing to consider how to implement
	Teacher forcing / question generation is also cool
