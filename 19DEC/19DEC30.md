Am I Daydreaming?
It has the effect of alertness and not daydreaming.
Like 'not' thinking about the elephant in the room.
Have I discovered something vastly superior to meditation.

Now am I multitasking of am I running a single-thread process but not able to realise?
Do we have the capability to record ALL the internal parallel chemical processes running in the body?

I'd like to meet Malcom Gladwell and chat the shit about all these philosophy angles I've been stumbling upon.
