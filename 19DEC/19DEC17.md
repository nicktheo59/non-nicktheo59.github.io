What is the purpose of this daily format? To archive or to summarise, amplify, and retain. Like a bicycle. 
Don't become sentimental about the text. If you want to see the room go up BEFORE 2pm, by bike.
Order veggies from sainsbury's = you have access to delivered food shopping here.
I would like to have server access to one.com tinkerbricks and the tool chain to edit and update the files automatically / immediately - using synchronisation.
