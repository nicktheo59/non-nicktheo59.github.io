Dream: I did like 4 Space jumps (no parachute needed)
Dad and Mum were in an apartment block I lived in the same complex and went up with Pav etc to see them or perhaps we all gathered at my place. I recalled something from I think from Rogan show which made me perceive that because I had done this jump my nerves in my regular life were rock steady - I experienced this as a kind of Andrenaline hangover / come down.

After I woke up at 5-6 I moved up to my second bed, because I had gotten terrible sleep the last couple of nights and although I was feeling OK to begin starting the day - I thought I would take advantage of my groggy state to repay my sleep debt. So, I spent an hour on the iPad playing a game and read some tutorial about the Python microframework - Flask. 
I kind of got the idea of what is going on behind the scenes at various websites - there are strings of text generated by the server side language (let's say in this case Python) and these strings correspond with valid HTML that will be rendered by the browser. --> That part I 'got' but I didn't quite wrap my head around the exact pendantics of how decorator functions work through taking in page routes (or view files?) as inputs and what, exactly, needs to get returned. This tutorial went from 0 to sixty a bit too quickly in my opinion, but when I get the time to sit down and figure it out (AND practise) I'm sure That I will figure it all out. Writing my own tutorial will perhaps be useful.

Anyway I turned back in around 8 and when I woke up I remembered one of my plans to get married and move to Dubai. It was around 3pm, and I hadn't eaten anything nutritious for a while (just sustaining myself on a Coco Pops and plain pasta along with a bit of haloumi cheese) - also in-between my slumbers I worried that I hadn't been weighing myself very regularly like I used to. So when I finally got up I weighed-in at around 86Kg which I pretty good for me (though all probably thanks to the hibernation) and then I went to boil Lentils on the stove along with 2 medium boiled eggs. I put the Greek TV on which I hadn't done in ages and picked up a new phrase αν η λαδι μετρα which means 'is the oil measures'. Because of the Python tutorial I wondered If I could auto generate the routes/hyperlinks for markdown files I am yet to write on this very website (I'll need a schema like /YY-MM-DD) - obviously because it is 'public' naturally there any be things I may hold back from talking about - but perhaps this could be an opportunity to test my encryption skills (by that I also mean develop them from 0). Wouldn't it be great if Evernote open sourced their built-in ability to do that - however that is very wishful thinking. If You could paste stuff into Evernote then encrypt sentences like a WWII censor might and output THAT as some kind of markdown file or webpage that relys on you (or selected trusted password holders) to de-encrypt all the passage text - that would be useful. But since this is all additional work the easiest thing is simply to not journal private things - but doesn't that defeat the point of doing it?  

Anyway this unintendedly turned into a WTF discussion about EVERnote so I'll just stop. The only other thing I wanted to note down was that when I was finally ready to sit down and potentially dedicate 10 minutes to writing this (which I did) as I turned off the TV there was a film / advert for Dubai. I was thinking about how tourism boards of Lyon and Angolia etc. have a difficult job to advertise a whole place and not get into the specifics of the individual local businesses etc. - but they are also pretty unimaginative to solve this problem if they were geniunely serious about moving the needle in terms of getting viewers to visit or invest - I would do something like what Dubai did (which is why it worked on me) pique their intrigure and point them to a url that can undercover more details about interviewed local businesses etc. -- In this case it was just a short film with Gwyenth Paltrow, but hey it's a start.


In a previous dream (in a different Apartment block) one of my romantic interests was living in the same complex and in the dream I was a 'hacker' with access to Wireshark but I decided to not look at wifi data packets in order to respect their privacy! (Even though it might have helped with getting them to reciprocate attraction somehow, I decided I would come to regret it if I did. Take note CIA; I felt dirty and that was a friggin dream.)


Another thing I recently learned about (as I i learnt that it exists) was masking IP addresses - it can look something like a MAC address if you want it to, ratherr than a string of numbers. Should I read the ''full guide' I found - it's only a paragraph or so but I don't really have a particular reason to hide my IP it is yet another useful skill. 


Speaking of skills - I wrote down about 90% of my technical projects yesterday (not even the business projects or projects that I Product Managed like Persona Jobs.) There was ALOT! I realised that this is probably what I have been doing intermittently these past 6 or so years that has eaten up my time - but it is all valid / cool experience that I can lead with as I apply to Product Manager jobs in Dubai (!)

An aside - can you imagine if you polled the entire visible (and dark) web for documents that mention today's date. That's the kind of data hoard Google has unprecidented access to. Potentially good for fighting crimes. But Planatir and these companies Renassiance Technologies - they have the world. The data and the means/skills of analysing it to identify patterns and earn profits at a serious scale. Though nothing can really compete with the good old Entrepreneur's eye and hustle to spot something and make it happen ahead of any marketing intelligence agency.
