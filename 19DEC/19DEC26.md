Brillouin Scattering

The Raman Process occurs on an energy scale that corresponds to optic vibrations.. On the other hand acoustic modes with small wave vectors have much lower energy.
=> It is possible to fulfil the conservation constraints that apply to neutron scattering in order to measure the acoustic mode dispersion curves over a very limted range of wave vector and energy.
==> We can measure the acoustic mode dispersion curves by imposing the conservation constraints (that ordinarily applyh to neutron scattering), so long as the acoustic mode dispersion curves are measured over a very limited range of wave vector and energy.

The scattering of photons from acoustic modes is called BRILLOUIN SCATTERING
From Brillouin scattering data it is possible to determine the elastic constants with reasonably high accuracy. 
It is possible to obtain better precision on the acoustic modes at low wave vector than is possible with neutron scattering. (Certainly it is)
It is also possible to perform measurements as a detailed function of external collisions. (Moreover it is).. which  means that BRILLOUIN  SCATTERING can be used to obtain information about the variation of elastic constants with respect to changes in temperature or pressure. 

Unlike Raman spectroscopy (but following inelastic neutron scattering) BRILLOUIN SCATTERING experiments need to be performed using single-CRYSTAL samples.
