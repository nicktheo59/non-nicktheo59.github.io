### Orchestral Symphony Project 2009

[![3-Minute Symphony](https://i.ibb.co/VCKM1sK/https-i-ytimg-com-vi-q-D-HN9-x-Zr-Y-maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD-HN9-xZrY "3-Minute Symphony (3 weeks of Work)")

This was 3 weeks of work (granted over the Christmas holiday) using Sibelius - the classical music composition software.
I really was going for a continuous 40+ minute track with at least 12 instruments. In the end I managed to match 2-minutes worth into a somewhat cohesive whole (the video above). My favourite is the last 30 seconds which everyone agrees should be the theme tune to a detective show. EVERYONE.

There were other musical fragments which seemed just barely good enough to graduate from their original description of 'sounds'. I decided to release these as two Shostakovich-inspired tracks imaginally entitled 'Happy' and 'Creepy'.
