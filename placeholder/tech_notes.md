HTML5 specification
Sass - programmable CSS
Vanilla JS - but Strict Static Typing
Pick a front End framework:
	React or Polymer's PWA Starter Kit (very similar)
Server Side Page rendering:
	Next.js
	Not necessary if LAMP?
Understand Web pack vs Parcel
Understand Linters / Linting
Use Gulp and other tools via npm or yarn

Unity or Unreal 
Blender for Assets and Animation 
WebVR etc?? Review that Intro to VR course in Dropbox

Back end Languages and frameworks:
	Adonis or Express
	Django or Flask
	Laravel or Lumen by Laravel or Zend
Databases:
	PostGresSQL or MariaDB or MYSQL - Relational
	Mongo - Document based
	Firebase - serverless
Microservices
	Firebase Cloud Functions
	AWS Lamba with micropayments in iOS
Apollo???
	It's a client-side library for creating GraphQL APIs
Vulcan??
	It's ....

My Main plan = get REALLY good at Python; PWAs; and Firebase Cloud Functions; also Docker containers

Does it make sense to have a Python-based front end framework?
	Perhaps to generate HTML CSS JS more efficiently?
How to make best use of TypeScript to include in my projects?
---
Jeeves lang with security built in
What is NativeScript??? I'm thinking of ReactNative - which is for mobile development; 
Is vue.js and nuxt.js worth looking at instead?
	It's all the same really just a a bit more modular - might be good if just learning actually

New plans, New Beginnings….

Community Commerce Brands → Fitness equipment, Security equipment, Solar Sub-Leasing
VR Science Teaching → Fund Raising & Development & Validating the concept

Shelved: Auto-Shares, BSFL, Character AR inventions book, 
Considering: 

My Location status:
Remote - techie product or support or writing or testing or UX working;
Relocate - Material Science ultimately Hyper Loop One Titanium Fast Forge Nano Coatings; 
Local – industry experience and potential installation partners / app biz dev for solar sub leasing idea


Why am I finally thinking so clearly right now?
Because my WebApp curiousity has been temporarily tamed, 
Because I listened to Dyson’s story first hand
Because I reviewed my past work and the narrative for the past ~5~ Months (June to Nov) is chaotic / defined...and I would like it to be clearly defined.
And because I stayed up all night on caffeine but actually focusing on getting this all down. 


The next chapter:
Escape the ‘island’ → When I sit down at my computer I want to have a clear vision for what I want to achieve.

I want to re-connect with the informed version of myself. A breadth of understanding and trove of perspectives, not necessarily walked solely by me; perhaps they are contrived insights from other people→ but it is more fun to venture down a path first-hand. Data-sources are important.


I want to resist too much ‘first principles’ thinking, it just slows me way down and output just grinds to a nothing; I would rather be wrong than not move.
