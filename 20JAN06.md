You don't get much satisafaction from sitting in an uncomfortable chair wondering what to do next.
I know that the FROGs are boulders you just have to move, but for me loosing the gravel around it would help get me going.
"Place to Look" => For tasks that is.
But there are no end to the number of possible ways to skin a cat (yikes that's a graphic turn of phrase!)
Time will chug on, don't even look at it. Just 2 hours slots. 
The thing is 25 minutes is supposed to be the max you can take before a 5 minute break is warranted -- for me that rule of thumb could be inverted -but that 5minutes or spike of productive output is like a shot of lightening that gets everyone excited.

I need at least a couple of them per day in order to believe I am doing a good job. The rest is over and the race really is on.
There are daily tasks that are an urgent emergencies - they are important and I have to create that sense of urgency.

The stuck-ness is exhaustable.

EVerything should be on Trello - here / notebooks should simply be placeholder thinking or planning space.

That was 1 hr - I remember setting an alarm. Another.
Basically I need piecemeal tasks that add up to be effective at both sharpening my mood and achieving an outcome valued by others.
Give 4 million, get 1 million.

Fuck Elad Gill is sheding light on my neighbourhood watch idea -- this log can prove I came up with the idea first/ indep -- but the DOING is what counts.


//4. ADT 2.0: Digital neighborhood watch.
The common approach to security cameras is to sell the camera as a DIY installation hardware sales and then charge an attach to cloud storage. However, the traditional path to home security includes services-centric companies like ADT. ADT will install the hardware for you, have a person in the middle in case needed for monitoring, and spins off cash like crazy due to its subscription model.

I would love to see a modern next-generation consumer-centric ADT-like model. This model would include:
Services model. Part of the purchase includes a technician showing up and doing the installation. There would be no DIY component.
Subscription only. The product would be a hardware/software/services bundle with an up front fee and ongoing subscription as default.
Network driven. All cameras in a neighborhood would be virtually networked - for example, as a user I could report that someone stole packages from my doorstep and an alert would go out to all my neighbors to their phones to bring their own packages inside. There are interesting network effects available here as well as the potential for a neighborhood social product to be built on top.
Data exhaust. If you have enough camera density by neighborhood, other things suddenly become interesting adjacent businesses. For example, could you add a pollution sensor to installs and get unique and valuable data? Weather data? There are lots of opportunities here outside of home security once you have an installed base.
I have long wanted to fund or incubate a company in this area. Nest and Ring are trying to do things on the consumer side, but not quite there yet. A company to watch in an adjacent area is Flock Safety.
